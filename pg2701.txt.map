for	1
scores	1
on	1
scores	1
of	1
miles	1
you	1
wade	1
knee	1
deep	1
among	1
tiger	1
lilies	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
charm	1
wanting	1
water	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
water	1
there	1
were	1
niagara	1
but	1
a	1
cataract	1
of	1
sand	1
would	1
you	1
travel	1
your	1
thousand	1
miles	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
poor	1
poet	1
of	1
tennessee	1
upon	1
suddenly	1
receiving	1
two	1
handfuls	1
of	1
silver	1
deliberate	1
whether	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
a	1
coat	1
which	1
he	1
sadly	1
needed	1
or	1
invest	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
trip	1
to	1
rockaway	1
beach	1
why	1
is	1
almost	1
every	1
robust	1
healthy	1
boy	1
with	1
a	1
robust	1
healthy	1
soul	1
in	1
him	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
crazy	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
why	1
upon	1
your	1
first	1
voyage	1
as	1
a	1
passenger	1
did	1
you	1
yourself	1
feel	1
such	1
a	1
mystical	1
vibration	1
when	1
first	1
told	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
ship	1
were	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
old	1
persians	1
hold	1
the	1
sea	1
holy	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
greeks	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
separate	1
deity	1
and	1
own	1
brother	1
of	1
jove	1
surely	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
meaning	1
and	1
still	1
deeper	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
story	1
of	1
narcissus	1
who	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
grasp	1
the	1
tormenting	1
mild	1
image	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
fountain	1
plunged	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
drowned	1
but	1
that	1
same	1
image	1
we	1
ourselves	1
see	1
in	1
all	1
rivers	1
and	1
oceans	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
ungraspable	1
phantom	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
it	1
all	1
	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sea	1
whenever	1
i	1
begin	1
to	1
grow	1
hazy	1
about	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
conscious	1
of	1
my	1
lungs	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
inferred	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
passenger	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
passenger	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
a	1
purse	1
and	1
a	1
purse	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
rag	1
unless	1
you	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
besides	1
passengers	1
get	1
sea	1
sick	1
grow	1
quarrelsome	1
don	1
t	1
sleep	1
of	1
nights	1
do	1
not	1
enjoy	1
themselves	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing	1
no	1
i	1
never	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
passenger	1
nor	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
salt	1
do	1
i	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
commodore	1
or	1
a	1
captain	1
or	1
a	1
cook	1
i	1
abandon	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
distinction	1
of	1
such	1
offices	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
them	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
i	1
abominate	1
all	1
honourable	1
respectable	1
toils	1
trials	1
and	1
tribulations	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
whatsoever	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself	1
without	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
ships	1
barques	1
brigs	1
schooners	1
and	1
what	1
not	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
going	1
as	1
cook	1
though	1
i	1
confess	1
there	1
is	1
considerable	1
glory	1
in	1
that	1
a	1
cook	1
being	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
officer	1
on	1
ship	1
board	1
yet	1
somehow	1
i	1
never	1
fancied	1
broiling	1
fowls	1
though	1
once	1
broiled	1
judiciously	1
buttered	1
and	1
judgmatically	1
salted	1
and	1
peppered	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
will	1
speak	1
more	1
respectfully	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
reverentially	1
of	1
a	1
broiled	1
fowl	1
than	1
i	1
will	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
idolatrous	1
dotings	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
egyptians	1
upon	1
broiled	1
ibis	1
and	1
roasted	1
river	1
horse	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
mummies	1
of	1
those	1
creatures	1
in	1
their	1
huge	1
bake	1
houses	1
the	1
pyramids	1
	1
no	1
when	1
i	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
i	1
go	1
as	1
a	1
simple	1
sailor	1
right	1
before	1
the	1
mast	1
plumb	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1
aloft	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
royal	1
mast	1
head	1
true	1
they	1
rather	1
order	1
me	1
about	1
some	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
jump	1
from	1
spar	1
to	1
spar	1
like	1
a	1
grasshopper	1
in	1
a	1
may	1
meadow	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
unpleasant	1
enough	1
it	1
touches	1
one	1
s	1
sense	1
of	1
honour	1
particularly	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
established	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
the	1
van	1
rensselaers	1
or	1
randolphs	1
or	1
hardicanutes	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
if	1
just	1
previous	1
to	1
putting	1
your	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
tar	1
pot	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
lording	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
country	1
schoolmaster	1
making	1
the	1
tallest	1
boys	1
stand	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
you	1
the	1
transition	1
is	1
a	1
keen	1
one	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
from	1
a	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
a	1
sailor	1
and	1
requires	1
a	1
strong	1
decoction	1
of	1
seneca	1
and	1
the	1
stoics	1
to	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
grin	1
and	1
bear	1
it	1
but	1
even	1
this	1
wears	1
off	1
in	1
time	1
	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
if	1
some	1
old	1
hunks	1
of	1
a	1
sea	1
captain	1
orders	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
broom	1
and	1
sweep	1
down	1
the	1
decks	1
what	1
does	1
that	1
indignity	1
amount	1
to	1
weighed	1
i	1
mean	1
in	1
the	1
scales	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
archangel	1
gabriel	1
thinks	1
anything	1
the	1
less	1
of	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
promptly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
obey	1
that	1
old	1
hunks	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
instance	1
who	1
ain	1
t	1
a	1
slave	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
well	1
then	1
however	1
the	1
old	1
sea	1
captains	1
may	1
order	1
me	1
about	1
however	1
they	1
may	1
thump	1
and	1
punch	1
me	1
about	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
right	1
that	1
everybody	1
else	1
is	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
served	1
in	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
either	1
in	1
a	1
physical	1
or	1
metaphysical	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
that	1
is	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
universal	1
thump	1
is	1
passed	1
round	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
should	1
rub	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
shoulder	1
blades	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
	1
again	1
i	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
because	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
paying	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
trouble	1
whereas	1
they	1
never	1
pay	1
passengers	1
a	1
single	1
penny	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
passengers	1
themselves	1
must	1
pay	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
between	1
paying	1
and	1
being	1
paid	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
paying	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
uncomfortable	1
infliction	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
orchard	1
thieves	1
entailed	1
upon	1
us	1
but	1
being	1
paid	1
what	1
will	1
compare	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
urbane	1
activity	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
receives	1
money	1
is	1
really	1
marvellous	1
considering	1
that	1
we	1
so	1
earnestly	1
believe	1
money	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
earthly	1
ills	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
can	1
a	1
monied	1
man	1
enter	1
heaven	1
ah	1
how	1
cheerfully	1
we	1
consign	1
ourselves	1
to	1
perdition	1
	1
finally	1
i	1
always	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wholesome	1
exercise	1
and	1
pure	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
fore	1
castle	1
deck	1
for	1
as	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
head	1
winds	1
are	1
far	1
more	1
prevalent	1
than	1
winds	1
from	1
astern	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
you	1
never	1
violate	1
the	1
pythagorean	1
maxim	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
the	1
commodore	1
on	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
gets	1
his	1
atmosphere	1
at	1
second	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
sailors	1
on	1
the	1
forecastle	1
he	1
thinks	1
he	1
breathes	1
it	1
first	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
in	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
do	1
the	1
commonalty	1
lead	1
their	1
leaders	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
leaders	1
little	1
suspect	1
it	1
but	1
wherefore	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
after	1
having	1
repeatedly	1
smelt	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
a	1
merchant	1
sailor	1
i	1
should	1
now	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
this	1
the	1
invisible	1
police	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
fates	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
constant	1
surveillance	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
secretly	1
dogs	1
me	1
and	1
influences	1
me	1
in	1
some	1
unaccountable	1
way	1
he	1
can	1
better	1
answer	1
than	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
and	1
doubtless	1
my	1
going	1
on	1
this	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
formed	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
programme	1
of	1
providence	1
that	1
was	1
drawn	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
it	1
came	1
in	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
brief	1
interlude	1
and	1
solo	1
between	1
more	1
extensive	1
performances	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
bill	1
must	1
have	1
run	1
something	1
like	1
this	1
	1
	1
grand	1
contested	1
election	1
for	1
the	1
presidency	1
of	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
by	1
one	1
ishmael	1
	1
bloody	1
battle	1
in	1
affghanistan	1
	1
	1
though	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
that	1
those	1
stage	1
managers	1
the	1
fates	1
put	1
me	1
down	1
for	1
this	1
shabby	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
when	1
others	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
for	1
magnificent	1
parts	1
in	1
high	1
tragedies	1
and	1
short	1
and	1
easy	1
parts	1
in	1
genteel	1
comedies	1
and	1
jolly	1
parts	1
in	1
farces	1
though	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
why	1
this	1
was	1
exactly	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
recall	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
into	1
the	1
springs	1
and	1
motives	1
which	1
being	1
cunningly	1
presented	1
to	1
me	1
under	1
various	1
disguises	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
performing	1
the	1
part	1
i	1
did	1
besides	1
cajoling	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
delusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
choice	1
resulting	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
unbiased	1
freewill	1
and	1
discriminating	1
judgment	1
	1
chief	1
among	1
these	1
motives	1
was	1
the	1
overwhelming	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whale	1
himself	1
such	1
a	1
portentous	1
and	1
mysterious	1
monster	1
roused	1
all	1
my	1
curiosity	1
then	1
the	1
wild	1
and	1
distant	1
seas	1
where	1
he	1
rolled	1
his	1
island	1
bulk	1
the	1
undeliverable	1
nameless	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
these	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
attending	1
marvels	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
patagonian	1
sights	1
and	1
sounds	1
helped	1
to	1
sway	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
wish	1
with	1
other	1
men	1
perhaps	1
such	1
things	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
inducements	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
tormented	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
itch	1
for	1
things	1
remote	1
i	1
love	1
to	1
sail	1
forbidden	1
seas	1
and	1
land	1
on	1
barbarous	1
coasts	1
not	1
ignoring	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
i	1
am	1
quick	1
to	1
perceive	1
a	1
horror	1
and	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
social	1
with	1
it	1
would	1
they	1
let	1
me	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
one	1
lodges	1
in	1
	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
then	1
the	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
was	1
welcome	1
the	1
great	1
flood	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
wonder	1
world	1
swung	1
open	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
conceits	1
that	1
swayed	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
purpose	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
there	1
floated	1
into	1
my	1
inmost	1

endless	1
processions	1
of	1

may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
related	1
that	1
i	1
for	1
one	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
so	1
doing	1
for	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
sail	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
a	1
nantucket	1
craft	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
boisterous	1
something	1
about	1
everything	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
famous	1
old	1
island	1
which	1
amazingly	1
pleased	1
me	1
besides	1
though	1
new	1
bedford	1
has	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
gradually	1
monopolising	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
and	1
though	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
poor	1
old	1
nantucket	1
is	1
now	1
much	1
behind	1
her	1
yet	1
nantucket	1
was	1
her	1
great	1
original	1
the	1
tyre	1
of	1
this	1
carthage	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
first	1
dead	1
american	1
whale	1
was	1
stranded	1
where	1
else	1
but	1
from	1
nantucket	1
did	1
those	1
aboriginal	1
whalemen	1
the	1
red	1
men	1
first	1
sally	1
out	1
in	1
canoes	1
to	1
give	1
chase	1
to	1
the	1
leviathan	1
and	1
where	1
but	1
from	1
nantucket	1
too	1
did	1
that	1
first	1
adventurous	1
little	1
sloop	1
put	1
forth	1
partly	1
laden	1
with	1
imported	1
cobblestones	1
so	1
goes	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
throw	1
at	1
the	1
whales	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
discover	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
nigh	1
enough	1
to	1
risk	1
a	1
harpoon	1
from	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
	1
now	1
having	1
a	1
night	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
still	1
another	1
night	1
following	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
ere	1
i	1
could	1
embark	1
for	1
my	1
destined	1
port	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
concernment	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep	1
meanwhile	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
dubious	1
looking	1
nay	1
a	1
very	1
dark	1
and	1
dismal	1
night	1
bitingly	1
cold	1
and	1
cheerless	1
i	1
knew	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
with	1
anxious	1
grapnels	1
i	1
had	1
sounded	1
my	1
pocket	1
and	1
only	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
few	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
so	1
wherever	1
you	1
go	1
ishmael	1
said	1
i	1
to	1
myself	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
dreary	1
street	1
shouldering	1
my	1
bag	1
and	1
comparing	1
the	1
gloom	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
wherever	1
in	1
your	1
wisdom	1
you	1
may	1
conclude	1
to	1
lodge	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
my	1
dear	1
ishmael	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
inquire	1
the	1
price	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
too	1
particular	1
	1
with	1
halting	1
steps	1
i	1
paced	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
crossed	1
harpoons	1
but	1
it	1
looked	1
too	1
expensive	1
and	1
jolly	1
there	1
further	1
on	1
from	1
the	1
bright	1
red	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
fish	1
inn	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
fervent	1
rays	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
melted	1
the	1
packed	1
snow	1
and	1
ice	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
everywhere	1
else	1
the	1
congealed	1
frost	1
lay	1
ten	1
inches	1
thick	1
in	1
a	1
hard	1
asphaltic	1
pavement	1
rather	1
weary	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
struck	1
my	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
flinty	1
projections	1
because	1
from	1
hard	1
remorseless	1
service	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
my	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
miserable	1
plight	1
too	1
expensive	1
and	1
jolly	1
again	1
thought	1
i	1
pausing	1
one	1
moment	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
broad	1
glare	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
tinkling	1
glasses	1
within	1
but	1
go	1
on	1
ishmael	1
said	1
i	1
at	1
last	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
hear	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
your	1
patched	1
boots	1
are	1
stopping	1
the	1
way	1
so	1
on	1
i	1
went	1
i	1
now	1
by	1
instinct	1
followed	1
the	1
streets	1
that	1
took	1
me	1
waterward	1
for	1
there	1
doubtless	1
were	1
the	1
cheapest	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
cheeriest	1
inns	1
	1
such	1
dreary	1
streets	1
blocks	1
of	1
blackness	1
not	1
houses	1
on	1
either	1
hand	1
and	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
candle	1
like	1
a	1
candle	1
moving	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
tomb	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
proved	1
all	1
but	1
deserted	1
but	1
presently	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
smoky	1
light	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
low	1
wide	1
building	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
stood	1
invitingly	1
open	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
careless	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
meant	1
for	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
so	1
entering	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
i	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
stumble	1
over	1
an	1
ash	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
ha	1
thought	1
i	1
ha	1
as	1
the	1
flying	1
particles	1
almost	1
choked	1
me	1
are	1
these	1
ashes	1
from	1
that	1
destroyed	1
city	1
gomorrah	1
but	1
the	1
crossed	1
harpoons	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
fish	1
this	1
then	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
however	1
i	1
picked	1
myself	1
up	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
within	1
pushed	1
on	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
second	1
interior	1
door	1
	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
great	1
black	1
parliament	1
sitting	1
in	1
tophet	1
a	1
hundred	1
black	1
faces	1
turned	1
round	1
in	1
their	1
rows	1
to	1
peer	1
and	1
beyond	1
a	1
black	1
angel	1
of	1
doom	1
was	1
beating	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
a	1
pulpit	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
negro	1
church	1
and	1
the	1
preacher	1
s	1
text	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
the	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing	1
and	1
teeth	1
gnashing	1
there	1
ha	1
ishmael	1
muttered	1
i	1
backing	1
out	1
wretched	1
entertainment	1
at	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
	1
moving	1
on	1
i	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
dim	1
sort	1
of	1
light	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
docks	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
forlorn	1
creaking	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
saw	1
a	1
swinging	1
sign	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
painting	1
upon	1
it	1
faintly	1
representing	1
a	1
tall	1
straight	1
jet	1
of	1
misty	1

these	1
words	1

rather	1
ominous	1
in	1
that	1

i	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
name	1
in	1
nantucket	1
they	1
say	1
and	1
i	1
suppose	1
this	1
peter	1
here	1
is	1
an	1
emigrant	1
from	1
there	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
looked	1
so	1
dim	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
looked	1
quiet	1
enough	1
and	1
the	1
dilapidated	1
little	1
wooden	1
house	1
itself	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
carted	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
some	1
burnt	1
district	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
swinging	1
sign	1
had	1
a	1
poverty	1
stricken	1
sort	1
of	1
creak	1
to	1
it	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
for	1
cheap	1
lodgings	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
pea	1

a	1
sharp	1

yourself	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1

straggling	1
entry	1
with	1
old	1
fashioned	1
wainscots	1
reminding	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
some	1
condemned	1
old	1
craft	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
hung	1
a	1
very	1

so	1
thoroughly	1
besmoked	1
and	1
every	1

defaced	1
that	1
in	1
the	1

by	1
which	1
you	1

it	1

only	1
by	1
diligent	1
study	1
and	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
systematic	1
visits	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
careful	1
inquiry	1
of	1
the	1
neighbors	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
any	1
way	1
arrive	1
at	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
its	1
purpose	1
such	1
unaccountable	1
masses	1
of	1
shades	1
and	1
shadows	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
you	1
almost	1
thought	1
some	1
ambitious	1
young	1
artist	1
in	1

of	1

by	1

contemplation	1

oft	1
repeated	1
ponderings	1

by	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
little	1
window	1

the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
entry	1
you	1
at	1

to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
however	1
wild	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
altogether	1
unwarranted	1
	1
but	1
what	1
most	1
puzzled	1
and	1
confounded	1
you	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
limber	1
portentous	1
black	1
mass	1
of	1
something	1
hovering	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1

three	1

lines	1
floating	1
in	1
a	1
nameless	1

enough	1
to	1
drive	1
a	1
nervous	1
man	1
distracted	1

was	1
there	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
indefinite	1
half	1
attained	1
unimaginable	1
sublimity	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
fairly	1
froze	1
you	1
to	1
it	1

you	1

a	1

of	1
young	1

gathered	1
about	1
a	1
table	1
examining	1
by	1
a	1
dim	1

divers	1
specimens	1
of	1

i	1
sought	1
the	1
landlord	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
i	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
accommodated	1
with	1
a	1
room	1
received	1
for	1
answer	1
that	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
full	1
not	1
a	1
bed	1
unoccupied	1
but	1
avast	1
he	1
added	1
tapping	1
his	1
forehead	1
you	1
haint	1
no	1
objections	1
to	1
sharing	1
a	1

ye	1
i	1
s	1

you	1

so	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
never	1
liked	1
to	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
should	1
ever	1
do	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
depend	1
upon	1
who	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
might	1
be	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
the	1
landlord	1
really	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
place	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
was	1
not	1
decidedly	1
objectionable	1
why	1
rather	1
than	1
wander	1
further	1
about	1
a	1
strange	1
town	1
on	1
so	1
bitter	1
a	1
night	1
i	1
would	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
any	1
decent	1
man	1
s	1
blanket	1
	1
i	1
thought	1
so	1
all	1
right	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
supper	1
you	1
want	1
supper	1
supper	1
ll	1
be	1
ready	1
directly	1
	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
wooden	1
settle	1
carved	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
bench	1
on	1
the	1
battery	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
a	1
ruminating	1
tar	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
adorning	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
jack	1
knife	1
stooping	1
over	1
and	1
diligently	1
working	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
his	1
legs	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
a	1
ship	1
under	1
full	1
sail	1
but	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
make	1
much	1
headway	1
i	1
thought	1
	1
at	1
last	1
some	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
our	1
meal	1
in	1
an	1
adjoining	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
cold	1
as	1
iceland	1
no	1
fire	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
landlord	1
said	1
he	1
couldn	1
t	1
afford	1
it	1
nothing	1
but	1
two	1
dismal	1
tallow	1
candles	1
each	1
in	1
a	1
winding	1
sheet	1
we	1
were	1
fain	1
to	1
button	1
up	1
our	1
monkey	1
jackets	1
and	1
hold	1
to	1
our	1
lips	1
cups	1
of	1
scalding	1
tea	1
with	1
our	1
half	1
frozen	1
fingers	1
but	1
the	1
fare	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
substantial	1
kind	1
not	1
only	1
meat	1
and	1
potatoes	1
but	1
dumplings	1
good	1
heavens	1
dumplings	1
for	1
supper	1
one	1
young	1
fellow	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
box	1
coat	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
these	1
dumplings	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
direful	1
manner	1
	1
my	1
boy	1
said	1
the	1
landlord	1
you	1
ll	1
have	1
the	1
nightmare	1
to	1
a	1
dead	1
sartainty	1
	1
landlord	1
i	1
whispered	1
that	1
aint	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
it	1
	1
oh	1
no	1
said	1
he	1
looking	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
diabolically	1
funny	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
a	1
dark	1
complexioned	1
chap	1
he	1
never	1
eats	1
dumplings	1
he	1
don	1
t	1
he	1
eats	1
nothing	1
but	1
steaks	1
and	1
he	1
likes	1
em	1
rare	1
	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
does	1
says	1
i	1
where	1
is	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
he	1
here	1
	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
here	1
afore	1
long	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
suspicious	1
of	1
this	1
dark	1
complexioned	1
harpooneer	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
i	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sleep	1
together	1
he	1
must	1
undress	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
bed	1
before	1
i	1
did	1
	1
supper	1
over	1
the	1
company	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
bar	1
room	1
when	1
knowing	1
not	1
what	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
myself	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
a	1
looker	1
on	1
	1
presently	1
a	1
rioting	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
without	1
starting	1
up	1
the	1
landlord	1
cried	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
grampus	1
s	1
crew	1
i	1
seed	1
her	1
reported	1
in	1
the	1
offing	1
this	1
morning	1
a	1
three	1
years	1
voyage	1
and	1
a	1
full	1
ship	1
hurrah	1
boys	1
now	1
we	1
ll	1
have	1
the	1
latest	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
feegees	1
	1
a	1
tramping	1
of	1
sea	1
boots	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
flung	1
open	1
and	1
in	1
rolled	1
a	1
wild	1
set	1
of	1
mariners	1
enough	1
enveloped	1
in	1
their	1
shaggy	1
watch	1
coats	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
muffled	1
in	1
woollen	1
comforters	1
all	1
bedarned	1
and	1
ragged	1
and	1
their	1
beards	1
stiff	1
with	1
icicles	1
they	1
seemed	1
an	1
eruption	1
of	1
bears	1
from	1
labrador	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
landed	1
from	1
their	1
boat	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
house	1
they	1
entered	1
no	1
wonder	1
then	1
that	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
straight	1
wake	1
for	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
mouth	1
the	1
bar	1
when	1
the	1
wrinkled	1
little	1
old	1
jonah	1
there	1
officiating	1
soon	1
poured	1
them	1
out	1
brimmers	1
all	1
round	1
one	1
complained	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
upon	1
which	1
jonah	1
mixed	1
him	1
a	1
pitch	1
like	1
potion	1
of	1
gin	1
and	1
molasses	1
which	1
he	1
swore	1
was	1
a	1
sovereign	1
cure	1
for	1
all	1
colds	1
and	1
catarrhs	1
whatsoever	1
never	1
mind	1
of	1
how	1
long	1
standing	1
or	1
whether	1
caught	1
off	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
labrador	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
weather	1
side	1
of	1
an	1
ice	1
island	1
	1
the	1
liquor	1
soon	1
mounted	1
into	1
their	1
heads	1
as	1
it	1
generally	1
does	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
arrantest	1
topers	1
newly	1
landed	1
from	1
sea	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
capering	1
about	1
most	1
obstreperously	1
	1
i	1
observed	1
however	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
somewhat	1
aloof	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
the	1
hilarity	1
of	1
his	1
shipmates	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sober	1
face	1
yet	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
refrained	1
from	1
making	1
as	1
much	1
noise	1
as	1
the	1
rest	1
this	1
man	1
interested	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
sea	1
gods	1
had	1
ordained	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
soon	1
become	1
my	1
shipmate	1
though	1
but	1
a	1
sleeping	1
partner	1
one	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
narrative	1
is	1
concerned	1
i	1
will	1
here	1
venture	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
description	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
stood	1
full	1
six	1
feet	1
in	1
height	1
with	1
noble	1
shoulders	1
and	1
a	1
chest	1
like	1
a	1
coffer	1
dam	1
i	1
have	1
seldom	1
seen	1
such	1
brawn	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
deeply	1
brown	1
and	1
burnt	1
making	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
dazzling	1
by	1
the	1
contrast	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
shadows	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
floated	1
some	1
reminiscences	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
much	1
joy	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
once	1
announced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
southerner	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
fine	1
stature	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
tall	1
mountaineers	1
from	1
the	1
alleghanian	1
ridge	1
in	1
virginia	1
when	1
the	1
revelry	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
mounted	1
to	1
its	1
height	1
this	1
man	1
slipped	1
away	1
unobserved	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
became	1
my	1
comrade	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
however	1
he	1
was	1
missed	1
by	1
his	1
shipmates	1
and	1
being	1
it	1
seems	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
a	1
huge	1
favourite	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
bulkington	1
bulkington	1
where	1
s	1
bulkington	1
and	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
him	1
	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
seeming	1
almost	1
supernaturally	1
quiet	1
after	1
these	1
orgies	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
myself	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
plan	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
	1
no	1
man	1
prefers	1
to	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
in	1
fact	1
you	1
would	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
rather	1
not	1
sleep	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
brother	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
people	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
private	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
sleeping	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
sleeping	1
with	1
an	1
unknown	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
inn	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town	1
and	1
that	1
stranger	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
then	1
your	1
objections	1
indefinitely	1
multiply	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
earthly	1
reason	1
why	1
i	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
should	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
for	1
sailors	1
no	1
more	1
sleep	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
at	1
sea	1
than	1
bachelor	1
kings	1
do	1
ashore	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
all	1
sleep	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
apartment	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
your	1
own	1
hammock	1
and	1
cover	1
yourself	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
blanket	1
and	1
sleep	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
skin	1
	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
pondered	1
over	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
abominated	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
sleeping	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
fair	1
to	1
presume	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
his	1
linen	1
or	1
woollen	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
tidiest	1
certainly	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
all	1
over	1
besides	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
late	1
and	1
my	1
decent	1
harpooneer	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
home	1
and	1
going	1
bedwards	1
suppose	1
now	1
he	1
should	1
tumble	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
midnight	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
tell	1
from	1
what	1
vile	1
hole	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
	1
landlord	1
i	1
ve	1
changed	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
sleep	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
ll	1
try	1
the	1
bench	1
here	1
	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
spare	1
ye	1
a	1
tablecloth	1
for	1
a	1
mattress	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
plaguy	1
rough	1
board	1
here	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
knots	1
and	1
notches	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
skrimshander	1
i	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
carpenter	1
s	1
plane	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
bar	1
wait	1
i	1
say	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
make	1
ye	1
snug	1
enough	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
procured	1
the	1
plane	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
first	1
dusting	1
the	1
bench	1
vigorously	1
set	1
to	1
planing	1
away	1
at	1
my	1
bed	1
the	1
while	1
grinning	1
like	1
an	1
ape	1
the	1
shavings	1
flew	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
plane	1
iron	1
came	1
bump	1
against	1
an	1
indestructible	1
knot	1
the	1
landlord	1
was	1
near	1
spraining	1
his	1
wrist	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
soft	1
enough	1
to	1
suit	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
planing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
make	1
eider	1
down	1
of	1
a	1
pine	1
plank	1
so	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
shavings	1
with	1
another	1
grin	1
and	1
throwing	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
stove	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
business	1
and	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
study	1
	1
i	1
now	1
took	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
bench	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
foot	1
too	1
short	1
but	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
mended	1
with	1
a	1
chair	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
foot	1
too	1
narrow	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
about	1
four	1
inches	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
planed	1
one	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
yoking	1
them	1
i	1
then	1
placed	1
the	1
first	1
bench	1
lengthwise	1
along	1
the	1
only	1
clear	1
space	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
leaving	1
a	1
little	1
interval	1
between	1
for	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
in	1
but	1
i	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
draught	1
of	1
cold	1
air	1
over	1
me	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
sill	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
that	1
this	1
plan	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
at	1
all	1
especially	1
as	1
another	1
current	1
from	1
the	1
rickety	1
door	1
met	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
both	1
together	1
formed	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
small	1
whirlwinds	1
in	1
the	1
immediate	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
	1
the	1
devil	1
fetch	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
thought	1
i	1
but	1
stop	1
couldn	1
t	1
i	1
steal	1
a	1
march	1
on	1
him	1
bolt	1
his	1
door	1
inside	1
and	1
jump	1
into	1
his	1
bed	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wakened	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
knockings	1
it	1
seemed	1
no	1
bad	1
idea	1
but	1
upon	1
second	1
thoughts	1
i	1
dismissed	1
it	1
for	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
popped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
might	1
be	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
all	1
ready	1
to	1
knock	1
me	1
down	1
	1
still	1
looking	1
round	1
me	1
again	1
and	1
seeing	1
no	1
possible	1
chance	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
sufferable	1
night	1
unless	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
person	1
s	1
bed	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
cherishing	1
unwarrantable	1
prejudices	1
against	1
this	1
unknown	1
harpooneer	1
thinks	1
i	1
i	1
ll	1
wait	1
awhile	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
dropping	1
in	1
before	1
long	1
i	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
then	1
and	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
become	1
jolly	1
good	1
bedfellows	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
telling	1
	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
other	1
boarders	1
kept	1
coming	1
in	1
by	1
ones	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
yet	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
my	1
harpooneer	1
	1
landlord	1
said	1
i	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
chap	1
is	1
he	1
does	1
he	1
always	1
keep	1
such	1
late	1
hours	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
hard	1
upon	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
	1
the	1
landlord	1
chuckled	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
lean	1
chuckle	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
mightily	1
tickled	1
at	1
something	1
beyond	1
my	1
comprehension	1
no	1
he	1
answered	1
generally	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
early	1
bird	1
airley	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
airley	1
to	1
rise	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
the	1
bird	1
what	1
catches	1
the	1
worm	1
but	1
to	1
night	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
peddling	1
you	1
see	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
what	1
on	1

keeps	1
him	1
so	1
late	1
unless	1
may	1
be	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
sell	1
his	1
head	1
	1
can	1
t	1
sell	1

head	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
bamboozingly	1
story	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
are	1
telling	1
me	1
getting	1
into	1
a	1
towering	1
rage	1
do	1
you	1
pretend	1
to	1
say	1
landlord	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
actually	1
engaged	1
this	1
blessed	1
saturday	1
night	1
or	1
rather	1
sunday	1
morning	1
in	1
peddling	1
his	1

around	1
this	1
town	1
	1
that	1
s	1
precisely	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
landlord	1
and	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
couldn	1
t	1
sell	1
it	1
here	1
the	1
market	1
s	1
overstocked	1
	1
with	1
what	1
shouted	1
i	1
	1
with	1
heads	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
ain	1
t	1
there	1
too	1
many	1
heads	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
landlord	1
said	1
i	1
quite	1
calmly	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
stop	1
spinning	1
that	1
yarn	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
m	1

taking	1
out	1

be	1
done	1
brown	1
if	1

a	1
slanderin	1

break	1

for	1
him	1

i	1
now	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
again	1
at	1
this	1
unaccountable	1
farrago	1
of	1
the	1
landlord	1
s	1
	1
it	1
s	1
broke	1
a	1
ready	1

that	1

the	1
very	1
reason	1
he	1

t	1
sell	1
it	1

said	1
i	1
going	1
up	1
to	1

about	1

seen	1
you	1
persist	1
in	1
telling	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
mystifying	1
and	1
exasperating	1
stories	1
tending	1
to	1
beget	1
in	1
me	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
feeling	1
towards	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
you	1
design	1
for	1
my	1
bedfellow	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
connexion	1
landlord	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
intimate	1
and	1
confidential	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
i	1
now	1
demand	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
and	1
whether	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
safe	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
unsay	1
that	1
story	1
about	1
selling	1
his	1
head	1
which	1
if	1
true	1
i	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
evidence	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
stark	1
mad	1
and	1
i	1
ve	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
sleeping	1
with	1
a	1
madman	1
and	1
you	1
sir	1
you	1
i	1
mean	1
landlord	1
you	1
sir	1
by	1
trying	1
to	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
knowingly	1
would	1
thereby	1
render	1
yourself	1
liable	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
prosecution	1

the	1

fetching	1
a	1
long	1
breath	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
purty	1
long	1
sarmon	1
for	1
a	1
chap	1

up	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
balmed	1
new	1
zealand	1
heads	1
great	1
curios	1
you	1

and	1
he	1

and	1
that	1

he	1
s	1
trying	1
to	1
sell	1
to	1
night	1
cause	1
to	1

about	1

streets	1
when	1
folks	1
is	1
goin	1
to	1
churches	1

wanted	1
to	1
last	1
sunday	1
but	1
i	1
stopped	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
goin	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
four	1
heads	1
strung	1
on	1
a	1
string	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
airth	1
like	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
inions	1
	1
this	1
account	1
cleared	1
up	1
the	1
otherwise	1
unaccountable	1
mystery	1
and	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
landlord	1
after	1
all	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
fooling	1
me	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
who	1
stayed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
saturday	1
night	1
clean	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
sabbath	1
engaged	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
cannibal	1
business	1
as	1
selling	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
dead	1
idolators	1
	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
landlord	1
that	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
man	1
	1
he	1
pays	1
reg	1
lar	1
was	1
the	1
rejoinder	1
but	1
come	1
it	1
s	1
getting	1
dreadful	1
late	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
turning	1
flukes	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
nice	1
bed	1
sal	1
and	1
me	1

i	1

a	1
dreaming	1
and	1
sprawling	1
about	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
somehow	1
sam	1
got	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
breaking	1
his	1
arm	1
arter	1
that	1
sal	1
said	1

jiffy	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
towards	1
me	1
offering	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
way	1
but	1
i	1
stood	1
irresolute	1
when	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
i	1
vum	1

do	1
come	1
won	1
t	1
ye	1
come	1
	1
i	1
considered	1
the	1
matter	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
up	1
stairs	1
we	1
went	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
ushered	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
cold	1
as	1
a	1
clam	1
and	1
furnished	1
sure	1
enough	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
bed	1
almost	1
big	1
enough	1
indeed	1
for	1
any	1
four	1
harpooneers	1
to	1
sleep	1
abreast	1
	1
there	1
said	1
the	1
landlord	1
placing	1
the	1
candle	1
on	1
a	1
crazy	1
old	1
sea	1
chest	1
that	1
did	1
double	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
wash	1
stand	1
and	1
centre	1
table	1
there	1
make	1
yourself	1
comfortable	1
now	1
and	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
ye	1
i	1
turned	1
round	1
from	1
eyeing	1
the	1
bed	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared	1
	1
folding	1
back	1
the	1
counterpane	1
i	1
stooped	1
over	1
the	1
bed	1
though	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
elegant	1
it	1
yet	1
stood	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
tolerably	1
well	1
i	1
then	1
glanced	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
besides	1
the	1
bedstead	1
and	1
centre	1
table	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
other	1
furniture	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
but	1
a	1
rude	1
shelf	1
the	1
four	1
walls	1
and	1
a	1
papered	1
fireboard	1
representing	1
a	1
man	1
striking	1
a	1
whale	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
hammock	1
lashed	1
up	1
and	1
thrown	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
also	1
a	1
large	1
seaman	1
s	1
bag	1
containing	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
s	1
wardrobe	1
no	1
doubt	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
trunk	1
likewise	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
outlandish	1
bone	1
fish	1
hooks	1
on	1
the	1
shelf	1
over	1
the	1
fire	1
place	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
harpoon	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
felt	1
it	1
and	1
smelt	1
it	1
and	1
tried	1
every	1
way	1
possible	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
satisfactory	1
conclusion	1
concerning	1
it	1
i	1
can	1
compare	1
it	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
large	1
door	1
mat	1
ornamented	1
at	1
the	1
edges	1
with	1
little	1
tinkling	1
tags	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
stained	1
porcupine	1
quills	1
round	1
an	1
indian	1
moccasin	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
hole	1
or	1
slit	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
mat	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
south	1
american	1
ponchos	1
but	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
any	1
sober	1
harpooneer	1
would	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
door	1
mat	1
and	1
parade	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
any	1
christian	1
town	1
in	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
guise	1
i	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
try	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
weighed	1
me	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
hamper	1
being	1
uncommonly	1
shaggy	1
and	1
thick	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
damp	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
mysterious	1
harpooneer	1
had	1
been	1
wearing	1
it	1
of	1
a	1
rainy	1
day	1
i	1
went	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
glass	1
stuck	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
i	1
tore	1
myself	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
that	1
i	1
gave	1
myself	1
a	1
kink	1
in	1
the	1
neck	1
	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
commenced	1
thinking	1
about	1
this	1
head	1
peddling	1
harpooneer	1
and	1
his	1
door	1
mat	1
after	1
thinking	1
some	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
side	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
monkey	1
jacket	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
thinking	1
i	1
then	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
coat	1
and	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
but	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
very	1
cold	1
now	1
half	1
undressed	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
and	1
remembering	1
what	1
the	1
landlord	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
s	1
not	1
coming	1
home	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
it	1
being	1
so	1
very	1
late	1
i	1
made	1
no	1
more	1
ado	1
but	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
pantaloons	1
and	1
boots	1
and	1
then	1
blowing	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
tumbled	1
into	1
bed	1
and	1
commended	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
heaven	1
	1
whether	1
that	1
mattress	1
was	1
stuffed	1
with	1
corn	1
cobs	1
or	1
broken	1
crockery	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1
but	1
i	1
rolled	1
about	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
slid	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
light	1
doze	1
and	1
had	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
offing	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
nod	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
footfall	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
glimmer	1
of	1
light	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
door	1
	1
lord	1
save	1
me	1
thinks	1
i	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
the	1
infernal	1
head	1
peddler	1
but	1
i	1
lay	1
perfectly	1
still	1
and	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
till	1
spoken	1
to	1
holding	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
that	1
identical	1
new	1
zealand	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
stranger	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
bed	1
placed	1
his	1
candle	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off	1
from	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
working	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
knotted	1
cords	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
bag	1
i	1
before	1
spoke	1
of	1
as	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
was	1
all	1
eagerness	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
it	1
averted	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
while	1
employed	1
in	1
unlacing	1
the	1
bag	1
s	1
mouth	1
this	1
accomplished	1
however	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
when	1
good	1
heavens	1
what	1
a	1
sight	1
such	1
a	1
face	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
purplish	1
yellow	1
colour	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
stuck	1
over	1
with	1
large	1
blackish	1
looking	1
squares	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
terrible	1
bedfellow	1
he	1
s	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
fight	1
got	1
dreadfully	1
cut	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
from	1
the	1
surgeon	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
towards	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
i	1
plainly	1
saw	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sticking	1
plasters	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
black	1
squares	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
they	1
were	1
stains	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
or	1
other	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
soon	1
an	1
inkling	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
remembered	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
a	1
whaleman	1
too	1
who	1
falling	1
among	1
the	1
cannibals	1
had	1
been	1
tattooed	1
by	1
them	1
i	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
distant	1
voyages	1
must	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
similar	1
adventure	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
thought	1
i	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
his	1
outside	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
honest	1
in	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
skin	1
but	1
then	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
his	1
unearthly	1
complexion	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
mean	1
lying	1
round	1
about	1
and	1
completely	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
squares	1
of	1
tattooing	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
coat	1
of	1
tropical	1
tanning	1
but	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
hot	1
sun	1
s	1
tanning	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
into	1
a	1
purplish	1
yellow	1
one	1
however	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
seas	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
sun	1
there	1
produced	1
these	1
extraordinary	1
effects	1
upon	1
the	1
skin	1
now	1
while	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
me	1
like	1
lightning	1
this	1
harpooneer	1
never	1
noticed	1
me	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
after	1
some	1
difficulty	1
having	1
opened	1
his	1
bag	1
he	1
commenced	1
fumbling	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
presently	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tomahawk	1
and	1
a	1
seal	1
skin	1
wallet	1
with	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
placing	1
these	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
the	1
new	1
zealand	1
head	1
a	1
ghastly	1
thing	1
enough	1
and	1
crammed	1
it	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
bag	1
he	1
now	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
a	1
new	1
beaver	1
hat	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
nigh	1
singing	1
out	1
with	1
fresh	1
surprise	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
none	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
at	1
least	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
scalp	1
knot	1
twisted	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
his	1
bald	1
purplish	1
head	1
now	1
looked	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
mildewed	1
skull	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
stranger	1
stood	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
bolted	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
quicker	1
than	1
ever	1
i	1
bolted	1
a	1
dinner	1
	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
thought	1
something	1
of	1
slipping	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
floor	1
back	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
coward	1
but	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this	1
head	1
peddling	1
purple	1
rascal	1
altogether	1
passed	1
my	1
comprehension	1
ignorance	1
is	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
being	1
completely	1
nonplussed	1
and	1
confounded	1
about	1
the	1
stranger	1
i	1
confess	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
as	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
who	1
had	1
thus	1
broken	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
night	1
in	1
fact	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
game	1
enough	1
just	1
then	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
and	1
demand	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
answer	1
concerning	1
what	1
seemed	1
inexplicable	1
in	1
him	1
	1
meanwhile	1
he	1
continued	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
undressing	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
showed	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
arms	1
as	1
i	1
live	1
these	1
covered	1
parts	1
of	1
him	1
were	1
checkered	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
squares	1
as	1
his	1
face	1
his	1
back	1
too	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
dark	1
squares	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
thirty	1
years	1
war	1
and	1
just	1
escaped	1
from	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
sticking	1
plaster	1
shirt	1
still	1
more	1
his	1
very	1
legs	1
were	1
marked	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
dark	1
green	1
frogs	1
were	1
running	1
up	1
the	1
trunks	1
of	1
young	1
palms	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
abominable	1
savage	1
or	1
other	1
shipped	1
aboard	1
of	1
a	1
whaleman	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
seas	1
and	1
so	1
landed	1
in	1
this	1
christian	1
country	1
i	1
quaked	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
peddler	1
of	1
heads	1
too	1
perhaps	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
brothers	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
mine	1
heavens	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
tomahawk	1
	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
shuddering	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
savage	1
went	1
about	1
something	1
that	1
completely	1
fascinated	1
my	1
attention	1
and	1
convinced	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
indeed	1
be	1
a	1
heathen	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
heavy	1
grego	1
or	1
wrapall	1
or	1
dreadnaught	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
previously	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
he	1
fumbled	1
in	1
the	1
pockets	1
and	1
produced	1
at	1
length	1
a	1
curious	1
little	1
deformed	1
image	1
with	1
a	1
hunch	1
on	1
its	1
back	1
and	1
exactly	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
a	1
three	1
days	1
old	1
congo	1
baby	1
remembering	1
the	1
embalmed	1
head	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
almost	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
black	1
manikin	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
baby	1
preserved	1
in	1
some	1
similar	1
manner	1
but	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
limber	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
glistened	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
like	1
polished	1
ebony	1
i	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
wooden	1
idol	1
which	1
indeed	1
it	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
now	1
the	1
savage	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
empty	1
fire	1
place	1
and	1
removing	1
the	1
papered	1
fire	1
board	1
sets	1
up	1
this	1
little	1
hunch	1
backed	1
image	1
like	1
a	1
tenpin	1
between	1
the	1
andirons	1
the	1
chimney	1
jambs	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
bricks	1
inside	1
were	1
very	1
sooty	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
thought	1
this	1
fire	1
place	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
appropriate	1
little	1
shrine	1
or	1
chapel	1
for	1
his	1
congo	1
idol	1
	1
i	1
now	1
screwed	1
my	1
eyes	1
hard	1
towards	1
the	1
half	1
hidden	1
image	1
feeling	1
but	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
meantime	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
follow	1
first	1
he	1
takes	1
about	1
a	1
double	1
handful	1
of	1
shavings	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grego	1
pocket	1
and	1
places	1
them	1
carefully	1
before	1
the	1
idol	1
then	1
laying	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
ship	1
biscuit	1
on	1
top	1
and	1
applying	1
the	1
flame	1
from	1
the	1
lamp	1
he	1
kindled	1
the	1
shavings	1
into	1
a	1
sacrificial	1
blaze	1
presently	1
after	1
many	1
hasty	1
snatches	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
still	1
hastier	1
withdrawals	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
whereby	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
scorching	1
them	1
badly	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
drawing	1
out	1
the	1
biscuit	1
then	1
blowing	1
off	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
ashes	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
polite	1
offer	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
negro	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
devil	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
fancy	1
such	1
dry	1
sort	1
of	1
fare	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
never	1
moved	1
his	1
lips	1
all	1
these	1
strange	1
antics	1
were	1
accompanied	1
by	1
still	1
stranger	1
guttural	1
noises	1
from	1
the	1
devotee	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
praying	1
in	1
a	1
sing	1
song	1
or	1
else	1
singing	1
some	1
pagan	1
psalmody	1
or	1
other	1
during	1
which	1
his	1
face	1
twitched	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
unnatural	1
manner	1
at	1
last	1
extinguishing	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
idol	1
up	1
very	1
unceremoniously	1
and	1
bagged	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
grego	1
pocket	1
as	1
carelessly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
sportsman	1
bagging	1
a	1
dead	1
woodcock	1
	1
all	1
these	1
queer	1
proceedings	1
increased	1
my	1
uncomfortableness	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
now	1
exhibiting	1
strong	1
symptoms	1
of	1
concluding	1
his	1
business	1
operations	1
and	1
jumping	1
into	1
bed	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
now	1
or	1
never	1
before	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
put	1
out	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
spell	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
bound	1
	1
but	1
the	1
interval	1
i	1
spent	1
in	1
deliberating	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
was	1
a	1
fatal	1
one	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
then	1
holding	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
at	1
the	1
handle	1
he	1
puffed	1
out	1
great	1
clouds	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
extinguished	1
and	1
this	1
wild	1
cannibal	1
tomahawk	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
sprang	1
into	1
bed	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
sang	1
out	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
now	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
sudden	1
grunt	1
of	1
astonishment	1
he	1
began	1
feeling	1
me	1
	1
stammering	1
out	1
something	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
i	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
and	1
then	1
conjured	1
him	1
whoever	1
or	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
light	1
the	1
lamp	1
again	1
but	1
his	1
guttural	1
responses	1
satisfied	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
but	1
ill	1
comprehended	1
my	1
meaning	1
	1
who	1
e	1
debel	1
you	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
said	1
you	1
no	1
speak	1
e	1
dam	1
me	1
i	1
kill	1
e	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
the	1
lighted	1
tomahawk	1
began	1
flourishing	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
	1
landlord	1
for	1
god	1

again	1
growled	1
the	1
cannibal	1
while	1
his	1
horrid	1
flourishings	1
of	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
scattered	1
the	1
hot	1
tobacco	1
ashes	1
about	1
me	1
till	1
i	1
thought	1
my	1
linen	1
would	1
get	1
on	1
fire	1
but	1
thank	1
heaven	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
landlord	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
light	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
leaping	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
i	1
ran	1
up	1

to	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
clothes	1
to	1

not	1

a	1
really	1
kind	1
and	1
charitable	1
way	1

the	1
counterpane	1
	1
	1
upon	1
waking	1
next	1
morning	1
about	1
daylight	1
i	1
found	1
queequeg	1
s	1
arm	1
thrown	1
over	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
loving	1
and	1
affectionate	1
manner	1
you	1
had	1
almost	1
thought	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
counterpane	1
was	1
of	1
patchwork	1
full	1
of	1
odd	1
little	1
parti	1
coloured	1
squares	1
and	1
triangles	1
and	1
this	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
tattooed	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
an	1
interminable	1
cretan	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
a	1
figure	1
no	1
two	1
parts	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
precise	1
shade	1
owing	1
i	1
suppose	1
to	1
his	1
keeping	1
his	1
arm	1
at	1
sea	1
unmethodically	1
in	1
sun	1
and	1
shade	1
his	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
irregularly	1
rolled	1
up	1
at	1
various	1
times	1
this	1
same	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
i	1
say	1
looked	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
that	1
same	1
patchwork	1
quilt	1
indeed	1
partly	1
lying	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
arm	1
did	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
awoke	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
quilt	1
they	1
so	1
blended	1
their	1
hues	1
together	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
weight	1
and	1
pressure	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
tell	1
that	1
queequeg	1
was	1
hugging	1
me	1
	1
my	1
sensations	1
were	1
strange	1
let	1
me	1
try	1
to	1
explain	1
them	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
i	1
well	1
remember	1
a	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
circumstance	1
that	1
befell	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
reality	1
or	1
a	1
dream	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
entirely	1
settle	1
the	1
circumstance	1
was	1
this	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
cutting	1
up	1
some	1
caper	1
or	1
other	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
crawl	1
up	1
the	1
chimney	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
little	1
sweep	1
do	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
previous	1
and	1
my	1
stepmother	1
who	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
whipping	1
me	1
or	1
sending	1
me	1
to	1
bed	1
supperless	1
my	1
mother	1
dragged	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
legs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney	1
and	1
packed	1
me	1
off	1
to	1
bed	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
the	1
21st	1
june	1
the	1
longest	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
in	1
our	1
hemisphere	1
i	1
felt	1
dreadfully	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
up	1
stairs	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
little	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
floor	1
undressed	1
myself	1
as	1
slowly	1
as	1
possible	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
kill	1
time	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bitter	1
sigh	1
got	1
between	1
the	1
sheets	1
	1
i	1
lay	1
there	1
dismally	1
calculating	1
that	1
sixteen	1
entire	1
hours	1
must	1
elapse	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
hope	1
for	1
a	1
resurrection	1
sixteen	1
hours	1
in	1
bed	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
my	1
back	1
ached	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
light	1
too	1
the	1
sun	1
shining	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
rattling	1
of	1
coaches	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
gay	1
voices	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
felt	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
got	1
up	1
dressed	1
and	1
softly	1
going	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
stockinged	1
feet	1
sought	1
out	1
my	1
stepmother	1
and	1
suddenly	1
threw	1
myself	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
beseeching	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
particular	1
favour	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
slippering	1
for	1
my	1
misbehaviour	1
anything	1
indeed	1
but	1
condemning	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
abed	1
such	1
an	1
unendurable	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
conscientious	1
of	1
stepmothers	1
and	1
back	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
i	1
lay	1
there	1
broad	1
awake	1
feeling	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
worse	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
since	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
subsequent	1
misfortunes	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
troubled	1
nightmare	1
of	1
a	1
doze	1
and	1
slowly	1
waking	1
from	1
it	1
half	1
steeped	1
in	1
dreams	1
i	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
before	1
sun	1
lit	1
room	1
was	1
now	1
wrapped	1
in	1
outer	1
darkness	1
instantly	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
shock	1
running	1
through	1
all	1
my	1
frame	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
but	1
a	1
supernatural	1
hand	1
seemed	1
placed	1
in	1
mine	1
my	1
arm	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
counterpane	1
and	1
the	1
nameless	1
unimaginable	1
silent	1
form	1
or	1
phantom	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
hand	1
belonged	1
seemed	1
closely	1
seated	1
by	1
my	1
bed	1
side	1
for	1
what	1
seemed	1
ages	1
piled	1
on	1
ages	1
i	1
lay	1
there	1
frozen	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
fears	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
drag	1
away	1
my	1
hand	1
yet	1
ever	1
thinking	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
but	1
stir	1
it	1
one	1
single	1
inch	1
the	1
horrid	1
spell	1
would	1
be	1
broken	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
this	1
consciousness	1
at	1
last	1
glided	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
shudderingly	1
remembered	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
afterwards	1
i	1
lost	1
myself	1
in	1
confounding	1
attempts	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
mystery	1
nay	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
hour	1
i	1
often	1
puzzle	1
myself	1
with	1
it	1
	1
now	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
awful	1
fear	1
and	1
my	1
sensations	1
at	1
feeling	1
the	1
supernatural	1
hand	1
in	1
mine	1
were	1
very	1
similar	1
in	1
their	1
strangeness	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
i	1
experienced	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
queequeg	1
s	1
pagan	1
arm	1
thrown	1
round	1
me	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
night	1
s	1
events	1
soberly	1
recurred	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
in	1
fixed	1
reality	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
lay	1
only	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
comical	1
predicament	1
for	1
though	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
his	1
arm	1
unlock	1
his	1
bridegroom	1
clasp	1
yet	1
sleeping	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
he	1
still	1
hugged	1
me	1
tightly	1
as	1
though	1
naught	1
but	1
death	1
should	1
part	1
us	1
twain	1
i	1
now	1
strove	1
to	1
rouse	1
him	1
queequeg	1
but	1
his	1
only	1
answer	1
was	1
a	1
snore	1
i	1
then	1
rolled	1
over	1
my	1
neck	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
horse	1
collar	1
and	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
a	1
slight	1
scratch	1
throwing	1
aside	1
the	1
counterpane	1
there	1
lay	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
sleeping	1
by	1
the	1
savage	1
s	1
side	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
hatchet	1
faced	1
baby	1
a	1
pretty	1
pickle	1
truly	1
thought	1
i	1
abed	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
cannibal	1
and	1
a	1
tomahawk	1
queequeg	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
goodness	1
queequeg	1
wake	1
at	1
length	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
much	1
wriggling	1
and	1
loud	1
and	1
incessant	1
expostulations	1
upon	1
the	1
unbecomingness	1
of	1
his	1
hugging	1
a	1
fellow	1
male	1
in	1
that	1
matrimonial	1
sort	1
of	1
style	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
extracting	1
a	1
grunt	1
and	1
presently	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
his	1
arm	1
shook	1
himself	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
newfoundland	1
dog	1
just	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
stiff	1
as	1
a	1
pike	1
staff	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
altogether	1
remember	1
how	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
though	1
a	1
dim	1
consciousness	1
of	1
knowing	1
something	1
about	1
me	1
seemed	1
slowly	1
dawning	1
over	1
him	1
meanwhile	1
i	1
lay	1
quietly	1
eyeing	1
him	1
having	1
no	1
serious	1
misgivings	1
now	1
and	1
bent	1
upon	1
narrowly	1
observing	1
so	1
curious	1
a	1
creature	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
his	1
mind	1
seemed	1
made	1
up	1
touching	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
his	1
bedfellow	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
he	1
jumped	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
by	1
certain	1
signs	1
and	1
sounds	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
pleased	1
me	1
he	1
would	1
dress	1
first	1
and	1
then	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
dress	1
afterwards	1
leaving	1
the	1
whole	1
apartment	1
to	1
myself	1
thinks	1
i	1
queequeg	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
civilized	1
overture	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
these	1
savages	1
have	1
an	1
innate	1
sense	1
of	1
delicacy	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
how	1
essentially	1
polite	1
they	1
are	1
i	1
pay	1
this	1
particular	1
compliment	1
to	1
queequeg	1
because	1
he	1
treated	1
me	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
civility	1
and	1
consideration	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
guilty	1
of	1
great	1
rudeness	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
watching	1
all	1
his	1
toilette	1
motions	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
my	1
curiosity	1
getting	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
my	1
breeding	1
nevertheless	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
queequeg	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
were	1
well	1
worth	1
unusual	1
regarding	1
	1
he	1
commenced	1
dressing	1
at	1
top	1
by	1
donning	1
his	1
beaver	1
hat	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
by	1
and	1
then	1
still	1
minus	1
his	1
trowsers	1
he	1
hunted	1
up	1
his	1
boots	1
what	1
under	1
the	1
heavens	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
but	1
his	1
next	1
movement	1
was	1
to	1
crush	1
himself	1
boots	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
hat	1
on	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
when	1
from	1
sundry	1
violent	1
gaspings	1
and	1
strainings	1
i	1
inferred	1
he	1
was	1
hard	1
at	1
work	1
booting	1
himself	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
law	1
of	1
propriety	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
is	1
any	1
man	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
private	1
when	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
boots	1
but	1
queequeg	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
transition	1
stage	1
neither	1
caterpillar	1
nor	1
butterfly	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
enough	1
civilized	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
his	1
outlandishness	1
in	1
the	1
strangest	1
possible	1
manners	1
his	1
education	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
completed	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
undergraduate	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
small	1
degree	1
civilized	1
he	1
very	1
probably	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
troubled	1
himself	1
with	1
boots	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
then	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
still	1
a	1
savage	1
he	1
never	1
would	1
have	1
dreamt	1
of	1
getting	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
emerged	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
very	1
much	1
dented	1
and	1
crushed	1
down	1
over	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
began	1
creaking	1
and	1
limping	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
being	1
much	1
accustomed	1
to	1
boots	1
his	1
pair	1
of	1
damp	1
wrinkled	1
cowhide	1
ones	1
probably	1
not	1
made	1
to	1
order	1
either	1
rather	1
pinched	1
and	1
tormented	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
go	1
off	1
of	1
a	1
bitter	1
cold	1
morning	1
	1
seeing	1
now	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
curtains	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
street	1
being	1
very	1
narrow	1
the	1
house	1
opposite	1
commanded	1
a	1
plain	1
view	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
observing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
indecorous	1
figure	1
that	1
queequeg	1
made	1
staving	1
about	1
with	1
little	1
else	1
but	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
boots	1
on	1
i	1
begged	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
to	1
accelerate	1
his	1
toilet	1
somewhat	1
and	1
particularly	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
his	1
pantaloons	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
complied	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
wash	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
any	1
christian	1
would	1
have	1
washed	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
queequeg	1
to	1
my	1
amazement	1
contented	1
himself	1
with	1
restricting	1
his	1
ablutions	1
to	1
his	1
chest	1
arms	1
and	1
hands	1
he	1
then	1
donned	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
hard	1
soap	1
on	1
the	1
wash	1
stand	1
centre	1
table	1
dipped	1
it	1
into	1
water	1
and	1
commenced	1
lathering	1
his	1
face	1
i	1
was	1
watching	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
razor	1
when	1
lo	1
and	1
behold	1
he	1
takes	1
the	1
harpoon	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
corner	1
slips	1
out	1
the	1
long	1
wooden	1
stock	1
unsheathes	1
the	1
head	1
whets	1
it	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
his	1
boot	1
and	1
striding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bit	1
of	1
mirror	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
begins	1
a	1
vigorous	1
scraping	1
or	1
rather	1
harpooning	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks	1
thinks	1
i	1
queequeg	1
this	1
is	1
using	1
rogers	1
s	1
best	1
cutlery	1
with	1
a	1
vengeance	1
afterwards	1
i	1
wondered	1
the	1
less	1
at	1
this	1
operation	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
fine	1
steel	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
harpoon	1
is	1
made	1
and	1
how	1
exceedingly	1
sharp	1
the	1
long	1
straight	1
edges	1
are	1
always	1
kept	1
	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
toilet	1
was	1
soon	1
achieved	1
and	1
he	1
proudly	1
marched	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
pilot	1
monkey	1
jacket	1
and	1
sporting	1

	1
i	1
quickly	1
followed	1

and	1
descending	1
into	1
the	1
bar	1
room	1
accosted	1
the	1
grinning	1
landlord	1
very	1
pleasantly	1
i	1
cherished	1
no	1
malice	1
towards	1
him	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
skylarking	1
with	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
my	1
bedfellow	1
	1
however	1
a	1
good	1
laugh	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
good	1
thing	1

rather	1

scarce	1

for	1
a	1
good	1

to	1

him	1
not	1
be	1
backward	1

let	1
him	1
cheerfully	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
anything	1
bountifully	1
laughable	1
about	1
him	1

sure	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
in	1
that	1
man	1
than	1
you	1
perhaps	1
think	1
for	1
	1
the	1
bar	1
room	1
was	1
now	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
boarders	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
dropping	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
previous	1
and	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
they	1
were	1
nearly	1
all	1

	1
you	1
could	1
pretty	1
plainly	1
tell	1
how	1
long	1
each	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
ashore	1
this	1
young	1
fellow	1
s	1
healthy	1
cheek	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
sun	1
toasted	1
pear	1
in	1
hue	1
and	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
smell	1
almost	1
as	1
musky	1
he	1
cannot	1
have	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
landed	1
from	1

voyage	1
that	1
man	1
next	1
him	1

a	1
few	1
shades	1
lighter	1
you	1
might	1
say	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
satin	1
wood	1
is	1
in	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
complexion	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
still	1
lingers	1
a	1
tropic	1
tawn	1
but	1
slightly	1
bleached	1
withal	1
he	1
doubtless	1
has	1
tarried	1
whole	1
weeks	1
ashore	1
but	1
who	1
could	1
show	1
a	1
cheek	1
like	1
queequeg	1
which	1
barred	1
with	1
various	1
tints	1
seemed	1
like	1
the	1
andes	1
western	1
slope	1
to	1
show	1
forth	1
in	1
one	1
array	1
contrasting	1
climates	1

	1
grub	1
ho	1
now	1
cried	1
the	1
landlord	1
flinging	1
open	1
a	1
door	1
and	1
in	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
breakfast	1
	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
world	1
thereby	1
become	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
manner	1
quite	1
self	1
possessed	1
in	1
company	1
not	1
always	1

ledyard	1

great	1
new	1
england	1
traveller	1
and	1
mungo	1
park	1
the	1

one	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
they	1
possessed	1
the	1
least	1
assurance	1
in	1
the	1
parlor	1
but	1
perhaps	1
the	1
mere	1
crossing	1
of	1
siberia	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
drawn	1
by	1
dogs	1
as	1
ledyard	1
did	1
or	1
the	1
taking	1
a	1
long	1
solitary	1
walk	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
stomach	1
in	1
the	1
negro	1
heart	1
of	1
africa	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
poor	1
mungo	1
s	1
performances	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
travel	1
i	1
say	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
mode	1
of	1
attaining	1
a	1
high	1
social	1
polish	1
still	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
anywhere	1
	1
these	1
reflections	1
just	1
here	1
are	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
good	1
stories	1
about	1
whaling	1
to	1
my	1
no	1
small	1
surprise	1
nearly	1
every	1
man	1
maintained	1
a	1
profound	1
silence	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
but	1
they	1
looked	1
embarrassed	1
yes	1
here	1
were	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
sea	1
dogs	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
bashfulness	1
had	1
boarded	1
great	1
whales	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas	1
entire	1
strangers	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
duelled	1
them	1

of	1

for	1

justified	1
his	1
bringing	1
his	1
harpoon	1
into	1
breakfast	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
using	1
it	1
there	1
without	1

reaching	1
over	1
the	1

with	1
it	1
to	1
the	1

jeopardy	1
of	1
many	1
heads	1

grappling	1
the	1
beefsteaks	1
towards	1
him	1

that	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
coolly	1
done	1
by	1

anything	1

	1
we	1

not	1
speak	1

all	1
queequeg	1

peculiarities	1
here	1
how	1
he	1
eschewed	1
coffee	1

hot	1

applied	1
his	1
undivided	1
attention	1
to	1

rare	1
enough	1
that	1
when	1

was	1

withdrew	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
into	1
the	1
public	1

lighted	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe	1

was	1
sitting	1
there	1
quietly	1

affected	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
scene	1

was	1
a	1
wondering	1
gaze	1
of	1
incredulous	1
curiosity	1
in	1
his	1
countenance	1
this	1
savage	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
present	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
notice	1
my	1
entrance	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
read	1

therefore	1
was	1
not	1
reading	1
those	1

inscriptions	1
on	1

any	1

appeared	1
there	1
were	1
now	1

knew	1
not	1

so	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
unrecorded	1
accidents	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
so	1
plainly	1
did	1
several	1
women	1
present	1
wear	1
the	1
countenance	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
trappings	1
of	1
some	1
unceasing	1
grief	1
that	1
i	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
here	1
before	1
me	1
were	1
assembled	1
those	1
in	1
whose	1
unhealing	1
hearts	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
bleak	1
tablets	1
sympathetically	1
caused	1
the	1
old	1
wounds	1
to	1
bleed	1
afresh	1

oh	1
ye	1
whose	1
dead	1
lie	1
buried	1

he	1
was	1

for	1

in	1
the	1
hardy	1
winter	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
old	1
age	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
old	1

which	1
seems	1
merging	1
into	1
a	1
second	1

for	1
among	1
all	1
the	1

of	1

shone	1

no	1
one	1
having	1
previously	1

could	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
behold	1
father	1
mapple	1
without	1
the	1
utmost	1
interest	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
engrafted	1
clerical	1
peculiarities	1
about	1
him	1
imputable	1
to	1
that	1
adventurous	1
maritime	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
led	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
i	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
carried	1
no	1
umbrella	1
and	1
certainly	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
carriage	1
for	1
his	1
tarpaulin	1
hat	1
ran	1
down	1
with	1
melting	1
sleet	1
and	1
his	1
great	1
pilot	1
cloth	1
jacket	1
seemed	1
almost	1
to	1
drag	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
with	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
it	1
had	1
absorbed	1
however	1
hat	1

were	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
removed	1
and	1
hung	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
space	1
in	1
an	1
adjacent	1
corner	1
when	1
arrayed	1
in	1
a	1
decent	1
suit	1
he	1
quietly	1
approached	1
the	1
pulpit	1
	1
like	1
most	1
old	1
fashioned	1

it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1

one	1

since	1
a	1

a	1
height	1
would	1
by	1
its	1
long	1
angle	1
with	1
the	1
floor	1
seriously	1
contract	1
the	1
already	1
small	1
area	1
of	1
the	1
chapel	1
the	1
architect	1
it	1
seemed	1
had	1
acted	1
upon	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
father	1
mapple	1
and	1
finished	1
the	1
pulpit	1
without	1
a	1
stairs	1
substituting	1
a	1
perpendicular	1
side	1
ladder	1
like	1
those	1
used	1
in	1
mounting	1
a	1
ship	1
from	1
a	1
boat	1
at	1
sea	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
whaling	1
captain	1
had	1
provided	1
the	1
chapel	1
with	1
a	1
handsome	1
pair	1
of	1
red	1
worsted	1
man	1
ropes	1
for	1
this	1
ladder	1
which	1
being	1
itself	1
nicely	1
headed	1
and	1
stained	1
with	1
a	1
mahogany	1
colour	1
the	1
whole	1
contrivance	1
considering	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
chapel	1
it	1
was	1
seemed	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
in	1
bad	1
taste	1
halting	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
ladder	1
and	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
grasping	1
the	1
ornamental	1
knobs	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
ropes	1
father	1
mapple	1
cast	1
a	1
look	1
upwards	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
truly	1
sailor	1
like	1
but	1
still	1
reverential	1
dexterity	1
hand	1
over	1
hand	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
as	1
if	1
ascending	1
the	1
main	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
vessel	1
	1
the	1
perpendicular	1
parts	1
of	1
this	1
side	1
ladder	1
as	1
is	1
usually	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
swinging	1
ones	1
were	1
of	1
cloth	1
covered	1
rope	1
only	1
the	1
rounds	1
were	1
of	1
wood	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
joint	1
at	1
my	1
first	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
pulpit	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
escaped	1
me	1
that	1
however	1
convenient	1
for	1
a	1
ship	1
these	1
joints	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
seemed	1
unnecessary	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
father	1
mapple	1
after	1
gaining	1
the	1
height	1
slowly	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
pulpit	1
deliberately	1
drag	1
up	1
the	1
ladder	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
deposited	1
within	1
leaving	1
him	1
impregnable	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
quebec	1
	1
i	1
pondered	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
fully	1
comprehending	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
father	1
mapple	1
enjoyed	1
such	1
a	1
wide	1
reputation	1
for	1
sincerity	1
and	1
sanctity	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
suspect	1
him	1
of	1
courting	1
notoriety	1
by	1
any	1
mere	1
tricks	1
of	1
the	1
stage	1
no	1
thought	1
i	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
sober	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
furthermore	1
it	1
must	1
symbolize	1
something	1
unseen	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
then	1
that	1
by	1
that	1
act	1
of	1
physical	1
isolation	1
he	1
signifies	1
his	1
spiritual	1
withdrawal	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
from	1
all	1
outward	1
worldly	1
ties	1
and	1
connexions	1

the	1

with	1
a	1

well	1
of	1

within	1

	1

the	1

not	1

of	1
the	1

borrowed	1
from	1

paused	1
a	1
little	1

kneeling	1
in	1
the	1

folded	1
his	1
large	1
brown	1
hands	1
across	1
his	1
chest	1
uplifted	1
his	1
closed	1

offered	1
a	1
prayer	1
so	1
deeply	1
devout	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
kneeling	1

praying	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
this	1
ended	1
in	1
prolonged	1
solemn	1
tones	1

tolling	1
of	1

that	1
is	1

changing	1
his	1

pealing	1
exultation	1

joy	1
	1
the	1

as	1

it	1
is	1
a	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
god	1
never	1

what	1
that	1
command	1
was	1
or	1
how	1
conveyed	1
which	1
he	1

command	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
god	1
would	1
have	1
us	1
do	1
are	1
hard	1
for	1
us	1
to	1

remember	1
that	1
and	1
hence	1
he	1

commands	1
us	1
than	1
endeavors	1
to	1
persuade	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
obey	1
god	1
we	1
must	1
disobey	1
ourselves	1

it	1

in	1
this	1

the	1

worthy	1
of	1

on	1
the	1

suspicion	1
of	1
something	1

at	1

after	1

boldness	1
to	1
his	1
face	1

looks	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
coward	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
confess	1
himself	1
suspected	1
but	1
that	1
itself	1
is	1
strong	1
suspicion	1
so	1
he	1
makes	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sailors	1
find	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
advertised	1
they	1
let	1
him	1
pass	1
and	1
he	1
descends	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
	1
who	1
s	1
there	1
cries	1
the	1
captain	1
at	1
his	1
busy	1
desk	1
hurriedly	1
making	1
out	1
his	1
papers	1
for	1
the	1
customs	1
who	1
s	1
there	1
oh	1
how	1
that	1
harmless	1
question	1
mangles	1
jonah	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
almost	1
turns	1
to	1
flee	1
again	1
but	1
he	1
rallies	1
i	1
seek	1
a	1
passage	1
in	1
this	1
ship	1
to	1
tarshish	1
how	1
soon	1
sail	1
ye	1
sir	1
thus	1
far	1
the	1
busy	1
captain	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
jonah	1
though	1
the	1
man	1
now	1
stands	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
does	1
he	1
hear	1
that	1
hollow	1
voice	1
than	1
he	1
darts	1
a	1
scrutinizing	1
glance	1
we	1
sail	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
coming	1
tide	1
at	1
last	1

slowly	1
answered	1
still	1
intently	1

calls	1
away	1
the	1

from	1
that	1
scent	1
i	1

with	1
ye	1

now	1
for	1
it	1

shipmates	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overlooked	1
in	1
this	1
history	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
fare	1
thereof	1
ere	1
the	1
craft	1
did	1
sail	1
and	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
context	1
this	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
	1
now	1
jonah	1
s	1
captain	1
shipmates	1
was	1
one	1
whose	1
discernment	1
detects	1
crime	1
in	1
any	1
but	1
whose	1
cupidity	1
exposes	1
it	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
penniless	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
shipmates	1
sin	1
that	1
pays	1
its	1
way	1
can	1
travel	1
freely	1

without	1
a	1
passport	1
whereas	1
virtue	1
if	1
a	1
pauper	1
is	1
stopped	1
at	1
all	1
frontiers	1
so	1
jonah	1
s	1
captain	1
prepares	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
jonah	1
s	1
purse	1
ere	1
he	1
judge	1
him	1
openly	1
he	1
charges	1
him	1
thrice	1
the	1
usual	1
sum	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
assented	1
to	1
then	1
the	1
captain	1
knows	1
that	1
jonah	1
is	1
a	1
fugitive	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
resolves	1
to	1
help	1
a	1
flight	1
that	1
paves	1
its	1
rear	1
with	1
gold	1
yet	1
when	1
jonah	1
fairly	1
takes	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
prudent	1
suspicions	1
still	1
molest	1
the	1
captain	1
he	1
rings	1
every	1
coin	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
counterfeit	1
not	1
a	1
forger	1
any	1
way	1
he	1
mutters	1
and	1
jonah	1
is	1
put	1
down	1
for	1
his	1
passage	1
point	1
out	1
my	1
state	1
room	1
sir	1
says	1
jonah	1
now	1
i	1
m	1

weary	1
i	1
need	1
sleep	1
thou	1
lookest	1
like	1
it	1
says	1
the	1
captain	1
there	1
s	1
thy	1
room	1
jonah	1
enters	1
and	1
would	1
lock	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
the	1
lock	1
contains	1
no	1
key	1
hearing	1
him	1
foolishly	1
fumbling	1
there	1
the	1
captain	1
laughs	1
lowly	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
mutters	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
convicts	1
cells	1
being	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
locked	1
within	1
all	1
dressed	1
and	1
dusty	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
jonah	1
throws	1
himself	1
into	1
his	1
berth	1
and	1
finds	1
the	1
little	1
state	1
room	1
ceiling	1
almost	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
close	1
and	1
jonah	1
gasps	1
then	1
in	1
that	1
contracted	1
hole	1
sunk	1
too	1
beneath	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
water	1
line	1
jonah	1
feels	1
the	1
heralding	1
presentiment	1
of	1
that	1
stifling	1
hour	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
shall	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
his	1
bowels	1
wards	1
	1
screwed	1
at	1
its	1
axis	1
against	1
the	1
side	1
a	1
swinging	1
lamp	1
slightly	1
oscillates	1
in	1
jonah	1
s	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
heeling	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
wharf	1
with	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
bales	1
received	1
the	1
lamp	1
flame	1
and	1
all	1
though	1
in	1
slight	1
motion	1
still	1
maintains	1
a	1
permanent	1
obliquity	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
though	1
in	1
truth	1
infallibly	1
straight	1
itself	1
it	1
but	1
made	1
obvious	1
the	1
false	1
lying	1
levels	1
among	1
which	1
it	1
hung	1
the	1
lamp	1
alarms	1
and	1
frightens	1
jonah	1
as	1
lying	1
in	1
his	1
berth	1
his	1
tormented	1
eyes	1
roll	1
round	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
this	1
thus	1
far	1
successful	1
fugitive	1
finds	1
no	1
refuge	1
for	1
his	1
restless	1
glance	1
but	1
that	1
contradiction	1
in	1
the	1
lamp	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
appals	1
him	1
the	1
floor	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
the	1
side	1
are	1
all	1
awry	1
oh	1
so	1
my	1
conscience	1
hangs	1
in	1
me	1
he	1
groans	1
straight	1
upwards	1
so	1
it	1
burns	1
but	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
crookedness	1
	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
after	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
drunken	1
revelry	1
hies	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
still	1
reeling	1
but	1
with	1
conscience	1
yet	1
pricking	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
plungings	1
of	1
the	1
roman	1
race	1
horse	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
strike	1
his	1
steel	1

the	1

from	1

the	1

for	1
tarshish	1
all	1
careening	1
glides	1

now	1
when	1
the	1

to	1

sleep	1
he	1
sees	1
no	1

raging	1
sea	1
feels	1
not	1
the	1

timbers	1
and	1
little	1

the	1

rush	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
whale	1
which	1
even	1
now	1
with	1
open	1

is	1
cleaving	1
the	1

after	1

shipmates	1
jonah	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
a	1
berth	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
but	1
the	1
frightened	1
master	1
comes	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
shrieks	1
in	1
his	1
dead	1
ear	1
what	1
meanest	1
thou	1
o	1
sleeper	1
arise	1
startled	1
from	1
his	1
lethargy	1
by	1
that	1
direful	1
cry	1
jonah	1
staggers	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
stumbling	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
grasps	1
a	1
shroud	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
is	1
sprung	1
upon	1
by	1
a	1
panther	1
billow	1
leaping	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
wave	1
after	1
wave	1
thus	1
leaps	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
finding	1
no	1
speedy	1
vent	1
runs	1
roaring	1
fore	1
and	1
aft	1
till	1
the	1
mariners	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
drowning	1
while	1
yet	1
afloat	1
and	1
ever	1
as	1
the	1
white	1
moon	1
shows	1
her	1
affrighted	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
steep	1
gullies	1
in	1
the	1
blackness	1
overhead	1
aghast	1
jonah	1
sees	1
the	1
rearing	1
bowsprit	1
pointing	1
high	1
upward	1
but	1
soon	1
beat	1
downward	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
tormented	1
deep	1
	1
terrors	1
upon	1
terrors	1
run	1
shouting	1
through	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
cringing	1
attitudes	1
the	1
god	1
fugitive	1
is	1
now	1
too	1
plainly	1
known	1
the	1
sailors	1
mark	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
certain	1
grow	1
their	1
suspicions	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
fully	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
truth	1
by	1
referring	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
to	1
high	1
heaven	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
casting	1
lots	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
lot	1
is	1
jonah	1
s	1
that	1
discovered	1
then	1
how	1
furiously	1
they	1
mob	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
questions	1
what	1
is	1
thine	1
occupation	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou	1
thy	1
country	1
what	1
people	1
but	1
mark	1
now	1
my	1
shipmates	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
poor	1
jonah	1
the	1
eager	1
mariners	1
but	1
ask	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
where	1
from	1
whereas	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
receive	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
those	1
questions	1
but	1
likewise	1
another	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
question	1
not	1
put	1
by	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
unsolicited	1
answer	1
is	1
forced	1
from	1
jonah	1
by	1
the	1
hard	1
hand	1
of	1
god	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
him	1
	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
hebrew	1
he	1
cries	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
fear	1
the	1
lord	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
heaven	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
fear	1
him	1
o	1
jonah	1
aye	1
well	1
mightest	1
thou	1
fear	1
the	1
lord	1
god	1
then	1
straightway	1
he	1
now	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
confession	1
whereupon	1
the	1
mariners	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
appalled	1
but	1
still	1
are	1
pitiful	1
for	1
when	1
jonah	1
not	1
yet	1
supplicating	1
god	1
for	1
mercy	1
since	1
he	1
but	1
too	1
well	1
knew	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
his	1
deserts	1
when	1
wretched	1
jonah	1
cries	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
mercifully	1
turn	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
seek	1
by	1
other	1
means	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
ship	1
but	1
all	1
in	1
vain	1
the	1
indignant	1
gale	1
howls	1
louder	1
then	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
raised	1
invokingly	1
to	1
god	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
they	1
not	1
unreluctantly	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
jonah	1
	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
jonah	1
taken	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
when	1
instantly	1
an	1
oily	1
calmness	1
floats	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
still	1
as	1
jonah	1
carries	1
down	1
the	1
gale	1
with	1
him	1
leaving	1
smooth	1
water	1
behind	1
he	1
goes	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
whirling	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
masterless	1
commotion	1
that	1
he	1
scarce	1
heeds	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
drops	1
seething	1
into	1
the	1
yawning	1
jaws	1
awaiting	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
shoots	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
ivory	1
teeth	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
white	1
bolts	1
upon	1
his	1
prison	1
then	1
jonah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
lord	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
s	1
belly	1
but	1
observe	1
his	1
prayer	1
and	1
learn	1
a	1
weighty	1
lesson	1
for	1
sinful	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
jonah	1
does	1
not	1
weep	1
and	1
wail	1
for	1
direct	1
deliverance	1
he	1
feels	1
that	1
his	1
dreadful	1
punishment	1
is	1
just	1
he	1
leaves	1
all	1
his	1
deliverance	1
to	1
god	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
that	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
pains	1
and	1
pangs	1
he	1
will	1
still	1
look	1
towards	1
his	1
holy	1
temple	1
and	1
here	1
shipmates	1
is	1
true	1
and	1
faithful	1
repentance	1
not	1
clamorous	1
for	1
pardon	1
but	1
grateful	1
for	1
punishment	1
and	1
how	1
pleasing	1
to	1
god	1
was	1
this	1
conduct	1
in	1
jonah	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
eventual	1
deliverance	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
shipmates	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
place	1
jonah	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
copied	1
for	1
his	1
sin	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
place	1
him	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
repentance	1
sin	1
not	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
it	1
like	1
jonah	1
	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
shrieking	1
slanting	1
storm	1
without	1
seemed	1
to	1
add	1
new	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
preacher	1
who	1
when	1
describing	1
jonah	1
s	1
sea	1
storm	1
seemed	1
tossed	1
by	1
a	1
storm	1
himself	1
his	1
deep	1
chest	1
heaved	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
ground	1
swell	1
his	1
tossed	1
arms	1
seemed	1
the	1
warring	1
elements	1
at	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
that	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
swarthy	1
brow	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
leaping	1
from	1
his	1
eye	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
simple	1
hearers	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
fear	1
that	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
them	1
	1
there	1
now	1
came	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
his	1
look	1
as	1
he	1
silently	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
standing	1
motionless	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
seemed	1
communing	1
with	1
god	1
and	1
himself	1
	1
but	1
again	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
towards	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
lowly	1
with	1
an	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
yet	1
manliest	1
humility	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words	1
	1
shipmates	1
god	1
has	1
laid	1
but	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
you	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
press	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
ye	1
by	1
what	1
murky	1
light	1
may	1
be	1
mine	1
the	1
lesson	1
that	1
jonah	1
teaches	1
to	1
all	1
sinners	1
and	1
therefore	1
to	1
ye	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
greater	1
sinner	1
than	1
ye	1
and	1
now	1
how	1
gladly	1
would	1
i	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
this	1
mast	1
head	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
hatches	1
there	1
where	1
you	1
sit	1
and	1
listen	1
as	1
you	1
listen	1
while	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
reads	1
me	1
that	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
awful	1
lesson	1
which	1
jonah	1
teaches	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
pilot	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
god	1
how	1
being	1
an	1
anointed	1
pilot	1
prophet	1
or	1
speaker	1
of	1
true	1
things	1
and	1
bidden	1
by	1
the	1
lord	1
to	1
sound	1
those	1
unwelcome	1
truths	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
nineveh	1
jonah	1
appalled	1
at	1
the	1
hostility	1
he	1
should	1
raise	1
fled	1
from	1
his	1
mission	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
escape	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
his	1
god	1
by	1
taking	1
ship	1
at	1
joppa	1
but	1
god	1
is	1
everywhere	1
tarshish	1
he	1
never	1
reached	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
god	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
swallowed	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
living	1
gulfs	1
of	1
doom	1
and	1
with	1
swift	1
slantings	1
tore	1
him	1
along	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
where	1
the	1
eddying	1
depths	1
sucked	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
weeds	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
watery	1
world	1
of	1
woe	1
bowled	1
over	1
him	1
yet	1
even	1
then	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
any	1
plummet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
hell	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
grounded	1
upon	1
the	1
ocean	1
s	1
utmost	1
bones	1
even	1
then	1
god	1
heard	1
the	1
engulphed	1
repenting	1
prophet	1
when	1
he	1
cried	1
then	1
god	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
fish	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
shuddering	1
cold	1
and	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
whale	1
came	1
breeching	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
warm	1
and	1
pleasant	1
sun	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
delights	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
earth	1
and	1
vomited	1
out	1
jonah	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
came	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
jonah	1
bruised	1
and	1
beaten	1
his	1
ears	1
like	1
two	1
sea	1
shells	1
still	1
multitudinously	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
jonah	1
did	1
the	1
almighty	1
s	1
bidding	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
shipmates	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
falsehood	1
that	1
was	1
it	1
	1
this	1

this	1
is	1
that	1
other	1
lesson	1
and	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1

of	1

who	1
slights	1
it	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
this	1

charms	1
from	1

duty	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
seeks	1
to	1
pour	1
oil	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
when	1
god	1
has	1
brewed	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
gale	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
seeks	1
to	1

rather	1
than	1
to	1
appal	1
woe	1
to	1
him	1
whose	1
good	1
name	1
is	1
more	1
to	1

to	1

to	1

as	1
the	1
great	1

paul	1
has	1
it	1
while	1
preaching	1
to	1
others	1
is	1
himself	1
a	1
castaway	1
	1
he	1
dropped	1
and	1
fell	1
away	1
from	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
then	1
lifting	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
them	1
again	1
showed	1
a	1
deep	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
heavenly	1
enthusiasm	1
but	1
oh	1
shipmates	1
on	1
the	1
starboard	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
woe	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sure	1
delight	1
and	1

of	1
that	1

friend	1
	1
	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
spouter	1
inn	1
from	1
the	1
chapel	1
i	1
found	1
queequeg	1
there	1
quite	1
alone	1
he	1
having	1
left	1
the	1
chapel	1
before	1
the	1
benediction	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
stove	1
hearth	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
was	1
holding	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
little	1
negro	1
idol	1
of	1
his	1
peering	1
hard	1
into	1
its	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
jack	1
knife	1
gently	1
whittling	1
away	1
at	1
its	1
nose	1
meanwhile	1
humming	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heathenish	1
way	1
	1
but	1
being	1
now	1
interrupted	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
image	1
and	1
pretty	1
soon	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
large	1
book	1
there	1
and	1
placing	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
lap	1
began	1
counting	1
the	1
pages	1
with	1
deliberate	1
regularity	1
at	1
every	1
fiftieth	1
page	1
as	1
i	1
fancied	1
stopping	1
a	1
moment	1
looking	1
vacantly	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
giving	1
utterance	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
drawn	1
gurgling	1
whistle	1
of	1
astonishment	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
begin	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
fifty	1
seeming	1
to	1
commence	1
at	1
number	1
one	1
each	1
time	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
count	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
fifties	1
being	1
found	1
together	1
that	1
his	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
pages	1
was	1
excited	1
	1
with	1
much	1
interest	1
i	1
sat	1
watching	1
him	1
savage	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
hideously	1
marred	1
about	1
the	1
face	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
his	1
countenance	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
disagreeable	1
you	1
cannot	1
hide	1
the	1
soul	1
through	1
all	1
his	1
unearthly	1
tattooings	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
honest	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
deep	1
eyes	1
fiery	1
black	1
and	1
bold	1
there	1
seemed	1
tokens	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
that	1
would	1
dare	1
a	1
thousand	1
devils	1
and	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
lofty	1
bearing	1
about	1
the	1
pagan	1
which	1
even	1
his	1
uncouthness	1
could	1
not	1
altogether	1
maim	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
cringed	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
creditor	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
that	1
his	1
head	1
being	1
shaved	1
his	1
forehead	1
was	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
freer	1
and	1
brighter	1
relief	1
and	1
looked	1
more	1
expansive	1
than	1
it	1
otherwise	1
would	1
this	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
decide	1
but	1
certain	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
phrenologically	1
an	1
excellent	1
one	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
ridiculous	1
but	1
it	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
general	1
washington	1
s	1
head	1
as	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
busts	1
of	1
him	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
long	1
regularly	1
graded	1
retreating	1
slope	1
from	1
above	1
the	1
brows	1
which	1
were	1
likewise	1
very	1
projecting	1
like	1
two	1
long	1
promontories	1
thickly	1
wooded	1
on	1
top	1
queequeg	1
was	1
george	1
washington	1
cannibalistically	1
developed	1
	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
thus	1
closely	1
scanning	1
him	1
half	1
pretending	1
meanwhile	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
storm	1
from	1
the	1
casement	1
he	1
never	1
heeded	1
my	1
presence	1
never	1
troubled	1
himself	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
glance	1
but	1
appeared	1
wholly	1
occupied	1
with	1
counting	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
the	1
marvellous	1
book	1
considering	1
how	1
sociably	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
sleeping	1
together	1
the	1
night	1
previous	1
and	1
especially	1
considering	1
the	1
affectionate	1
arm	1
i	1
had	1
found	1
thrown	1
over	1
me	1
upon	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
thought	1
this	1
indifference	1
of	1
his	1
very	1
strange	1
but	1
savages	1
are	1
strange	1
beings	1
at	1
times	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
exactly	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
at	1
first	1
they	1
are	1
overawing	1
their	1
calm	1
self	1
collectedness	1
of	1
simplicity	1
seems	1
a	1
socratic	1
wisdom	1
i	1
had	1
noticed	1
also	1
that	1
queequeg	1
never	1
consorted	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
but	1
very	1
little	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
seamen	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
advances	1
whatever	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
enlarge	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
all	1
this	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
mighty	1
singular	1
yet	1
upon	1
second	1
thoughts	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
almost	1
sublime	1
in	1
it	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
some	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
miles	1
from	1
home	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
cape	1
horn	1
that	1
is	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
there	1
thrown	1
among	1
people	1
as	1
strange	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
planet	1
jupiter	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
seemed	1
entirely	1
at	1
his	1
ease	1
preserving	1
the	1
utmost	1
serenity	1
content	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
companionship	1
always	1
equal	1
to	1
himself	1
surely	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
fine	1
philosophy	1
though	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
that	1
but	1
perhaps	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
philosophers	1
we	1
mortals	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
so	1
living	1
or	1
so	1
striving	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
hear	1
that	1
such	1
or	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
gives	1
himself	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
philosopher	1
i	1
conclude	1
that	1
like	1
the	1
dyspeptic	1
old	1
woman	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
broken	1
his	1
digester	1
	1
as	1
i	1
sat	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
now	1
lonely	1
room	1
the	1
fire	1
burning	1
low	1
in	1
that	1
mild	1
stage	1
when	1
after	1
its	1
first	1
intensity	1
has	1
warmed	1
the	1
air	1
it	1
then	1
only	1
glows	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
evening	1
shades	1
and	1
phantoms	1
gathering	1
round	1
the	1
casements	1
and	1
peering	1
in	1
upon	1
us	1
silent	1
solitary	1
twain	1
the	1
storm	1
booming	1
without	1
in	1
solemn	1
swells	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
strange	1
feelings	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
melting	1
in	1
me	1
no	1
more	1
my	1
splintered	1
heart	1
and	1
maddened	1
hand	1
were	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
wolfish	1
world	1
this	1
soothing	1
savage	1
had	1
redeemed	1
it	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
his	1
very	1
indifference	1
speaking	1
a	1
nature	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
lurked	1
no	1
civilized	1
hypocrisies	1
and	1
bland	1
deceits	1
wild	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
sights	1
to	1
see	1
yet	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
myself	1
mysteriously	1
drawn	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
those	1
same	1
things	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
repelled	1
most	1
others	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
magnets	1
that	1
thus	1
drew	1
me	1
i	1
ll	1
try	1
a	1
pagan	1
friend	1
thought	1
i	1
since	1
christian	1
kindness	1
has	1
proved	1
but	1
hollow	1
courtesy	1
i	1
drew	1
my	1
bench	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
friendly	1
signs	1
and	1
hints	1
doing	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
meanwhile	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
little	1
noticed	1
these	1
advances	1
but	1
presently	1
upon	1
my	1
referring	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
night	1
s	1
hospitalities	1
he	1
made	1
out	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
whether	1
we	1
were	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
bedfellows	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
yes	1
whereat	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
pleased	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
complimented	1
	1
we	1
then	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
together	1
and	1
i	1
endeavored	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
printing	1
and	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
pictures	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
it	1
thus	1
i	1
soon	1
engaged	1
his	1
interest	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
jabbering	1
the	1
best	1
we	1
could	1
about	1
the	1
various	1
outer	1
sights	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
this	1
famous	1
town	1
soon	1
i	1
proposed	1
a	1
social	1
smoke	1
and	1
producing	1
his	1
pouch	1
and	1
tomahawk	1
he	1
quietly	1
offered	1
me	1
a	1
puff	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
sat	1
exchanging	1
puffs	1
from	1
that	1
wild	1
pipe	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
keeping	1
it	1
regularly	1
passing	1
between	1
us	1
	1
if	1
there	1
yet	1
lurked	1
any	1
ice	1
of	1
indifference	1
towards	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
pagan	1
s	1
breast	1
this	1
pleasant	1
genial	1
smoke	1
we	1
had	1
soon	1
thawed	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
cronies	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
me	1
quite	1
as	1
naturally	1
and	1
unbiddenly	1
as	1
i	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
when	1
our	1
smoke	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
pressed	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
mine	1
clasped	1
me	1
round	1
the	1
waist	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
were	1
married	1
meaning	1
in	1
his	1
country	1
s	1
phrase	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
bosom	1
friends	1
he	1
would	1
gladly	1
die	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
need	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
countryman	1
this	1
sudden	1
flame	1
of	1
friendship	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
far	1
too	1
premature	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
distrusted	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
simple	1
savage	1
those	1
old	1
rules	1
would	1
not	1
apply	1
	1
after	1
supper	1
and	1
another	1
social	1
chat	1
and	1
smoke	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
our	1
room	1
together	1
he	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
his	1
embalmed	1
head	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
enormous	1
tobacco	1
wallet	1
and	1
groping	1
under	1
the	1
tobacco	1
drew	1
out	1
some	1
thirty	1
dollars	1
in	1
silver	1
then	1
spreading	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
mechanically	1
dividing	1
them	1
into	1
two	1
equal	1
portions	1
pushed	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
mine	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
remonstrate	1
but	1
he	1
silenced	1
me	1
by	1
pouring	1
them	1
into	1
my	1
trowsers	1
pockets	1
i	1
let	1
them	1
stay	1
he	1
then	1
went	1
about	1
his	1
evening	1
prayers	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
idol	1
and	1
removed	1
the	1
paper	1
fireboard	1
by	1
certain	1
signs	1
and	1
symptoms	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
but	1
well	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow	1
i	1
deliberated	1
a	1
moment	1
whether	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
invited	1
me	1
i	1
would	1
comply	1
or	1
otherwise	1
	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
christian	1
born	1
and	1
bred	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
infallible	1
presbyterian	1
church	1
how	1
then	1
could	1
i	1
unite	1
with	1
this	1
wild	1
idolator	1
in	1
worshipping	1
his	1
piece	1
of	1
wood	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
worship	1
thought	1
i	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
now	1
ishmael	1
that	1

without	1
some	1
little	1

	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
i	1

there	1
is	1
no	1

some	1

over	1

nightgown	1
	1
	1
we	1
had	1
lain	1
thus	1
in	1
bed	1
chatting	1
and	1
napping	1
at	1
short	1
intervals	1
and	1
queequeg	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
affectionately	1
throwing	1
his	1
brown	1
tattooed	1
legs	1
over	1
mine	1
and	1
then	1
drawing	1
them	1
back	1
so	1
entirely	1
sociable	1
and	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
were	1
we	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
our	1
confabulations	1
what	1
little	1
nappishness	1
remained	1
in	1
us	1
altogether	1
departed	1
and	1
we	1
felt	1
like	1
getting	1
up	1
again	1
though	1
day	1
break	1
was	1
yet	1
some	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
future	1
	1
yes	1
we	1
became	1
very	1
wakeful	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
our	1
recumbent	1
position	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
wearisome	1
and	1
by	1
little	1
and	1
little	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
sitting	1
up	1
the	1
clothes	1
well	1
tucked	1
around	1
us	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
head	1
board	1
with	1
our	1
four	1
knees	1
drawn	1
up	1
close	1
together	1
and	1
our	1
two	1
noses	1
bending	1
over	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
our	1
kneepans	1
were	1
warming	1
pans	1
we	1
felt	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
snug	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
chilly	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
indeed	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
clothes	1
too	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
i	1
say	1
because	1
truly	1
to	1
enjoy	1
bodily	1
warmth	1
some	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
cold	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
quality	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
merely	1
by	1
contrast	1
nothing	1
exists	1
in	1
itself	1
if	1
you	1
flatter	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
over	1
comfortable	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
then	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
comfortable	1
any	1
more	1
but	1
if	1
like	1
queequeg	1
and	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
your	1
nose	1
or	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
be	1
slightly	1
chilled	1
why	1
then	1
indeed	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
consciousness	1
you	1
feel	1
most	1
delightfully	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
warm	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
a	1
sleeping	1
apartment	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
fire	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
luxurious	1
discomforts	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
for	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
deliciousness	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
blanket	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
snugness	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
air	1
then	1
there	1
you	1
lie	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
warm	1
spark	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
an	1
arctic	1
crystal	1
	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
crouching	1
manner	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
open	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
when	1
between	1
sheets	1
whether	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
whether	1
asleep	1
or	1
awake	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
always	1
keeping	1
my	1
eyes	1
shut	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
concentrate	1
the	1
snugness	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
bed	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
ever	1
feel	1
his	1
own	1
identity	1
aright	1
except	1
his	1
eyes	1
be	1
closed	1
as	1
if	1
darkness	1
were	1
indeed	1
the	1
proper	1
element	1
of	1
our	1
essences	1
though	1
light	1
be	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
our	1
clayey	1
part	1
upon	1
opening	1
my	1
eyes	1
then	1
and	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
pleasant	1
and	1
self	1
created	1
darkness	1
into	1
the	1
imposed	1
and	1
coarse	1
outer	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
unilluminated	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
at	1
night	1
i	1
experienced	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
revulsion	1
nor	1
did	1
i	1
at	1
all	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
hint	1
from	1
queequeg	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
were	1
best	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
light	1
seeing	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
wide	1
awake	1
and	1
besides	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
quiet	1
puffs	1
from	1
his	1
tomahawk	1

a	1

repugnance	1
to	1
his	1
smoking	1
in	1
the	1

how	1

grow	1
when	1
love	1
once	1
comes	1
to	1
bend	1
them	1
for	1

i	1
liked	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
queequeg	1
smoking	1
by	1
me	1
even	1
in	1
bed	1
because	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
serene	1
household	1
joy	1
then	1
i	1
no	1
more	1
felt	1
unduly	1
concerned	1
for	1
the	1
landlord	1
s	1
policy	1
of	1
insurance	1
i	1
was	1
only	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
condensed	1
confidential	1
comfortableness	1
of	1
sharing	1
a	1
pipe	1
and	1
a	1
blanket	1
with	1
a	1
real	1
friend	1
with	1
our	1
shaggy	1
jackets	1
drawn	1
about	1
our	1

we	1
now	1
passed	1
the	1
tomahawk	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
till	1
slowly	1
there	1
grew	1
over	1
us	1
a	1
blue	1
hanging	1
tester	1
of	1
smoke	1
illuminated	1
by	1
the	1

of	1

spoke	1
of	1

eager	1

hear	1
his	1

him	1
to	1

gladly	1
complied	1

at	1

ill	1

the	1

vowed	1

in	1

paddled	1
off	1
to	1
a	1

must	1
pass	1
through	1
when	1

quitted	1
the	1

on	1
one	1

was	1
a	1

on	1

a	1
low	1
tongue	1
of	1
land	1
covered	1
with	1
mangrove	1
thickets	1
that	1
grew	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
hiding	1
his	1
canoe	1
still	1
afloat	1
among	1
these	1
thickets	1
with	1
its	1
prow	1
seaward	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
paddle	1
low	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
gliding	1
by	1
like	1
a	1
flash	1
he	1
darted	1
out	1
gained	1

with	1
one	1
backward	1
dash	1
of	1

it	1
go	1
though	1
hacked	1
in	1
pieces	1
	1
in	1
vain	1
the	1

his	1

to	1
visit	1

the	1
captain	1
at	1
last	1
relented	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
himself	1
at	1
home	1
but	1
this	1
fine	1
young	1
savage	1
this	1
sea	1
prince	1
of	1
wales	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
captain	1
s	1
cabin	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
sailors	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
whaleman	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
like	1
czar	1
peter	1
content	1
to	1
toil	1
in	1
the	1
shipyards	1
of	1

cities	1
queequeg	1
disdained	1
no	1
seeming	1

if	1
thereby	1

happily	1
gain	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
enlightening	1
his	1
untutored	1
countrymen	1
for	1
at	1
bottom	1
so	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
actuated	1
by	1
a	1
profound	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
among	1
the	1
christians	1
the	1
arts	1
whereby	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
people	1
still	1
happier	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
still	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
but	1
alas	1
the	1
practices	1
of	1
whalemen	1
soon	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
even	1
christians	1
could	1
be	1
both	1
miserable	1
and	1
wicked	1
infinitely	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
heathens	1
arrived	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
old	1
sag	1
harbor	1
and	1
seeing	1
what	1
the	1
sailors	1
did	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
going	1
on	1
to	1
nantucket	1
and	1
seeing	1
how	1
they	1
spent	1
their	1
wages	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
also	1
poor	1
queequeg	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
lost	1
thought	1
he	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
wicked	1
world	1
in	1
all	1
meridians	1
i	1
ll	1
die	1
a	1
pagan	1
	1
and	1
thus	1
an	1
old	1
idolator	1
at	1
heart	1
he	1
yet	1
lived	1
among	1
these	1
christians	1
wore	1
their	1
clothes	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
their	1
gibberish	1
hence	1
the	1
queer	1
ways	1
about	1
him	1
though	1
now	1
some	1
time	1
from	1
home	1
	1
by	1
hints	1
i	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
propose	1
going	1
back	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
coronation	1
since	1
he	1
might	1
now	1
consider	1
his	1
father	1
dead	1
and	1
gone	1
he	1
being	1
very	1
old	1
and	1
feeble	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
accounts	1
he	1
answered	1
no	1
not	1
yet	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fearful	1
christianity	1
or	1
rather	1
christians	1
had	1
unfitted	1
him	1
for	1

to	1
go	1
to	1
sea	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
vocation	1
upon	1
this	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
whaling	1
was	1
my	1
own	1
design	1
and	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1

out	1

could	1
not	1

to	1
be	1
of	1

at	1

now	1
and	1
then	1
stopping	1
to	1
adjust	1
the	1
sheath	1
on	1
his	1

i	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
carried	1
such	1
a	1
troublesome	1
thing	1
with	1
him	1
ashore	1
and	1
whether	1
all	1

did	1
not	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
harpoons	1
to	1
this	1
in	1
substance	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
though	1
what	1
i	1
hinted	1
was	1
true	1
enough	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
particular	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
harpoon	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
assured	1
stuff	1
well	1
tried	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
mortal	1
combat	1
and	1
deeply	1
intimate	1
with	1
the	1

of	1

in	1

to	1

them	1
even	1
so	1
queequeg	1
for	1

story	1
about	1

ever	1
seen	1

in	1

to	1

his	1
heavy	1
chest	1
to	1
his	1
boarding	1
house	1
not	1
to	1
seem	1
ignorant	1
about	1
the	1
thing	1
though	1
in	1

he	1
was	1
entirely	1
so	1
concerning	1
the	1
precise	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
manage	1
the	1
barrow	1
queequeg	1
puts	1
his	1

upon	1

entire	1
after	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
whom	1
queequeg	1
had	1
handled	1
so	1
roughly	1
was	1
swept	1
overboard	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1
and	1
to	1
attempt	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
boom	1
to	1
stay	1
it	1
seemed	1
madness	1
it	1
flew	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
almost	1
in	1
one	1
ticking	1
of	1
a	1
watch	1
and	1
every	1
instant	1
seemed	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
snapping	1
into	1
splinters	1
nothing	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
nothing	1
seemed	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
done	1
those	1
on	1
deck	1
rushed	1
towards	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
stood	1
eyeing	1
the	1
boom	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
exasperated	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
consternation	1
queequeg	1
dropped	1
deftly	1
to	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
crawling	1
under	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
boom	1
whipped	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
rope	1
secured	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
and	1
then	1
flinging	1
the	1
other	1
like	1
a	1
lasso	1
caught	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
boom	1
as	1
it	1
swept	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
jerk	1
the	1
spar	1
was	1
that	1
way	1
trapped	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
safe	1
the	1
schooner	1
was	1
run	1
into	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
hands	1
were	1
clearing	1
away	1
the	1
stern	1
boat	1
queequeg	1
stripped	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
darted	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
living	1
arc	1
of	1
a	1
leap	1
for	1
three	1
minutes	1
or	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
swimming	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
throwing	1
his	1
long	1
arms	1
straight	1
out	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
turns	1
revealing	1
his	1
brawny	1
shoulders	1
through	1
the	1
freezing	1
foam	1
i	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
grand	1

saw	1
no	1

gone	1
down	1
shooting	1
himself	1
perpendicularly	1
from	1
the	1

queequeg	1
now	1
took	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
glance	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
seeming	1
to	1
see	1
just	1
how	1
matters	1
were	1
dived	1
down	1
and	1
disappeared	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
again	1
one	1
arm	1
still	1
striking	1
out	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
dragging	1
a	1
lifeless	1

the	1
boat	1
soon	1
picked	1
them	1
up	1

restored	1

at	1

deserved	1

from	1

for	1

of	1

down	1
upon	1

over	1
the	1

resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
in	1
the	1

direction	1
setting	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
canoes	1
after	1
a	1
perilous	1
passage	1
they	1
discovered	1
the	1

found	1
an	1
empty	1
ivory	1
casket	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1

	1
what	1
wonder	1
then	1
that	1
these	1
nantucketers	1
born	1
on	1
a	1
beach	1
should	1
take	1
to	1
the	1

caught	1

	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
little	1
moss	1
came	1
snugly	1
to	1
anchor	1
and	1
queequeg	1
and	1
i	1
went	1
ashore	1
so	1
we	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
no	1
business	1
that	1
day	1
at	1
least	1
none	1
but	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
a	1
bed	1
the	1
landlord	1
of	1
the	1
spouter	1
inn	1
had	1
recommended	1
us	1
to	1
his	1
cousin	1
hosea	1
hussey	1
of	1
the	1
try	1
pots	1
whom	1
he	1
asserted	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
proprietor	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
kept	1
hotels	1
in	1
all	1
nantucket	1
and	1
moreover	1
he	1
had	1
assured	1
us	1
that	1
cousin	1
hosea	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
his	1
chowders	1
in	1
short	1
he	1
plainly	1
hinted	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
do	1
better	1
than	1
try	1
pot	1
luck	1
at	1
the	1
try	1
pots	1
but	1
the	1
directions	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
us	1
about	1
keeping	1
a	1
yellow	1
warehouse	1
on	1
our	1
starboard	1
hand	1
till	1
we	1
opened	1
a	1
white	1
church	1
to	1
the	1
larboard	1
and	1
then	1
keeping	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
hand	1
till	1
we	1
made	1
a	1
corner	1
three	1
points	1
to	1
the	1
starboard	1
and	1
that	1
done	1
then	1
ask	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
we	1
met	1
where	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
these	1
crooked	1
directions	1
of	1
his	1
very	1
much	1
puzzled	1
us	1
at	1
first	1
especially	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
outset	1
queequeg	1
insisted	1
that	1
the	1
yellow	1
warehouse	1
our	1
first	1
point	1
of	1
departure	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
hand	1
whereas	1
i	1
had	1
understood	1
peter	1
coffin	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
starboard	1
however	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
beating	1
about	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
knocking	1
up	1
a	1
peaceable	1
inhabitant	1
to	1
inquire	1
the	1
way	1
we	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
something	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mistaking	1
	1
two	1
enormous	1
wooden	1
pots	1
painted	1
black	1
and	1
suspended	1
by	1
asses	1

swung	1
from	1
the	1

in	1

of	1
the	1
cross	1
trees	1
were	1
sawed	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
old	1
top	1
mast	1
looked	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
like	1
a	1
gallows	1
perhaps	1
i	1
was	1
over	1
sensitive	1
to	1
such	1
impressions	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
staring	1
at	1
this	1
gallows	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
misgiving	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
crick	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
neck	1
as	1
i	1
gazed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
remaining	1
horns	1
yes	1

of	1
them	1

for	1

called	1
from	1
these	1

by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
freckled	1
woman	1
with	1
yellow	1
hair	1
and	1
a	1
yellow	1
gown	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
under	1
a	1
dull	1
red	1
lamp	1
swinging	1
there	1
that	1
looked	1
much	1
like	1
an	1
injured	1
eye	1
and	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
brisk	1
scolding	1
with	1
a	1

and	1
so	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
mr	1

hussey	1
being	1
from	1
home	1
but	1
leaving	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
entirely	1
competent	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
affairs	1
upon	1
making	1
known	1
our	1
desires	1
for	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
a	1
bed	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
postponing	1
further	1
scolding	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
ushered	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
room	1
and	1
seating	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
spread	1
with	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
a	1
recently	1
concluded	1
repast	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1

repeated	1
	1
a	1

for	1

a	1
cold	1

that	1
what	1
you	1

says	1
i	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
rather	1
cold	1
and	1
clammy	1
reception	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
time	1
ain	1
t	1
it	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
	1
but	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
to	1
resume	1
scolding	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
purple	1
shirt	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
and	1
seeming	1
to	1
hear	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
clam	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
hurried	1
towards	1
an	1
open	1
door	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
and	1
bawling	1
out	1
clam	1
for	1
two	1
disappeared	1
	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
a	1
supper	1
for	1
us	1
both	1
on	1
one	1
clam	1
	1
however	1
a	1
warm	1
savory	1
steam	1
from	1
the	1
kitchen	1
served	1
to	1
belie	1
the	1
apparently	1
cheerless	1
prospect	1
before	1
us	1
but	1
when	1
that	1
smoking	1
chowder	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
mystery	1
was	1
delightfully	1
explained	1
oh	1
sweet	1
friends	1
hearken	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
small	1
juicy	1
clams	1
scarcely	1
bigger	1
than	1
hazel	1
nuts	1
mixed	1
with	1
pounded	1
ship	1
biscuit	1
and	1
salted	1
pork	1
cut	1
up	1
into	1
little	1
flakes	1
the	1
whole	1
enriched	1
with	1
butter	1
and	1
plentifully	1
seasoned	1
with	1
pepper	1
and	1
salt	1
our	1
appetites	1
being	1
sharpened	1
by	1
the	1
frosty	1
voyage	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
queequeg	1
seeing	1
his	1
favourite	1
fishing	1
food	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
chowder	1
being	1
surpassingly	1
excellent	1
we	1
despatched	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
expedition	1
when	1
leaning	1
back	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
bethinking	1
me	1
of	1

i	1
thought	1
i	1
would	1
try	1
a	1
little	1
experiment	1
stepping	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door	1
i	1
uttered	1
the	1
word	1
cod	1
with	1
great	1
emphasis	1
and	1
resumed	1
my	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
savoury	1
steam	1
came	1
forth	1
again	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
different	1
flavor	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
a	1
fine	1
cod	1
chowder	1
was	1
placed	1
before	1
us	1
	1

resumed	1

while	1
plying	1
our	1
spoons	1
in	1
the	1

to	1

our	1

to	1
my	1
surprise	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
concern	1
queequeg	1
now	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
diligently	1
consulting	1
yojo	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
little	1
god	1
and	1
yojo	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
over	1
and	1
strongly	1
insisted	1
upon	1
it	1
everyway	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
going	1
together	1
among	1
the	1
whaling	1
fleet	1
in	1
harbor	1
and	1
in	1
concert	1
selecting	1
our	1
craft	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
i	1
say	1
yojo	1
earnestly	1
enjoined	1
that	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
should	1
rest	1
wholly	1
with	1
me	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
yojo	1
purposed	1
befriending	1
us	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
had	1
already	1
pitched	1
upon	1
a	1
vessel	1
which	1
if	1
left	1
to	1
myself	1
i	1
ishmael	1
should	1
infallibly	1
light	1
upon	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
by	1
chance	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
vessel	1
i	1
must	1
immediately	1
ship	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
irrespective	1
of	1
queequeg	1
	1
i	1
have	1
forgotten	1
to	1
mention	1
that	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
queequeg	1
placed	1
great	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
excellence	1
of	1
yojo	1
s	1
judgment	1
and	1
surprising	1
forecast	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
cherished	1
yojo	1
with	1
considerable	1
esteem	1
as	1
a	1
rather	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
god	1
who	1
perhaps	1
meant	1
well	1
enough	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
his	1
benevolent	1
designs	1
	1
now	1
this	1
plan	1
of	1
queequeg	1
s	1
or	1
rather	1
yojo	1
s	1
touching	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
our	1
craft	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
plan	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
relied	1
upon	1
queequeg	1
s	1
sagacity	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
whaler	1
best	1
fitted	1
to	1
carry	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
fortunes	1
securely	1
but	1
as	1
all	1
my	1
remonstrances	1
produced	1
no	1
effect	1
upon	1
queequeg	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
acquiesce	1
and	1
accordingly	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
this	1
business	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
rushing	1
sort	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
vigor	1
that	1
should	1
quickly	1
settle	1
that	1
trifling	1
little	1
affair	1
next	1
morning	1
early	1
leaving	1
queequeg	1
shut	1
up	1
with	1
yojo	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
bedroom	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
lent	1
or	1
ramadan	1
or	1
day	1
of	1
fasting	1
humiliation	1
and	1
prayer	1
with	1
queequeg	1
and	1
yojo	1
that	1
day	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
find	1
out	1
for	1
though	1
i	1
applied	1
myself	1
to	1
it	1
several	1
times	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
master	1
his	1
liturgies	1
and	1
xxxix	1
articles	1
leaving	1
queequeg	1
then	1
fasting	1
on	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe	1
and	1
yojo	1
warming	1
himself	1
at	1
his	1
sacrificial	1
fire	1
of	1
shavings	1
i	1
sallied	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
shipping	1
after	1
much	1
prolonged	1
sauntering	1
and	1
many	1
random	1
inquiries	1
i	1
learnt	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
ships	1
up	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
voyages	1
the	1
devil	1
dam	1
the	1
tit	1

the	1
pequod	1
devil	1
dam	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
tit	1
bit	1
is	1
obvious	1
pequod	1
you	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
remember	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
celebrated	1
tribe	1
of	1
massachusetts	1
indians	1
now	1
extinct	1
as	1
the	1
ancient	1
medes	1
i	1
peered	1
and	1
pryed	1
about	1
the	1
devil	1
dam	1
from	1
her	1
hopped	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
tit	1
bit	1
and	1
finally	1
going	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
pequod	1
looked	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
decided	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
ship	1
for	1
us	1
	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
a	1
quaint	1
craft	1
in	1

what	1
not	1

take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
you	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
rare	1
old	1
craft	1
as	1
this	1
same	1
rare	1
old	1
pequod	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
school	1
rather	1
small	1
if	1
anything	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
fashioned	1
claw	1
footed	1
look	1
about	1
her	1
long	1
seasoned	1
and	1
weather	1
stained	1
in	1
the	1
typhoons	1
and	1
calms	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
oceans	1
her	1
old	1
hull	1
s	1
complexion	1
was	1
darkened	1
like	1
a	1
french	1
grenadier	1
s	1
who	1
has	1
alike	1
fought	1
in	1
egypt	1
and	1
siberia	1
her	1
venerable	1
bows	1
looked	1
bearded	1
her	1
masts	1
cut	1
somewhere	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
japan	1
where	1
her	1
original	1
ones	1
were	1
lost	1
overboard	1
in	1
a	1
gale	1
her	1
masts	1
stood	1
stiffly	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
spines	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
old	1
kings	1
of	1
cologne	1
her	1
ancient	1
decks	1
were	1
worn	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
like	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
worshipped	1
flag	1
stone	1
in	1
canterbury	1
cathedral	1
where	1
becket	1
bled	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
her	1
old	1
antiquities	1
were	1
added	1
new	1
and	1
marvellous	1
features	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
business	1
that	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
she	1
had	1
followed	1
old	1
captain	1

many	1
years	1
her	1
chief	1

before	1
he	1
commanded	1
another	1

of	1

a	1

the	1

this	1
old	1
peleg	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
his	1
chief	1

had	1
built	1
upon	1
her	1
original	1
grotesqueness	1

inlaid	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
quaintness	1

of	1

of	1
a	1
craft	1
tricking	1
herself	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
chased	1
bones	1
of	1
her	1
enemies	1
all	1
round	1
her	1
unpanelled	1
open	1
bulwarks	1
were	1
garnished	1
like	1
one	1
continuous	1
jaw	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
inserted	1
there	1
for	1
pins	1
to	1
fasten	1
her	1
old	1
hempen	1
thews	1
and	1
tendons	1
to	1
those	1
thews	1
ran	1
not	1
through	1
base	1
blocks	1
of	1
land	1
wood	1
but	1
deftly	1
travelled	1
over	1
sheaves	1
of	1
sea	1
ivory	1
scorning	1
a	1
turnstile	1
wheel	1
at	1
her	1
reverend	1
helm	1
she	1
sported	1
there	1
a	1
tiller	1
and	1
that	1
tiller	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
mass	1
curiously	1
carved	1
from	1
the	1
long	1
narrow	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
her	1
hereditary	1
foe	1
the	1
helmsman	1
who	1
steered	1
by	1
that	1
tiller	1
in	1
a	1
tempest	1
felt	1
like	1
the	1
tartar	1
when	1
he	1
holds	1
back	1
his	1
fiery	1
steed	1
by	1
clutching	1
its	1
jaw	1
a	1
noble	1
craft	1
but	1
somehow	1
a	1
most	1
melancholy	1
all	1
noble	1
things	1
are	1
touched	1
with	1
that	1
	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
looked	1
about	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
having	1
authority	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
propose	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
saw	1
nobody	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
overlook	1
a	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
tent	1
or	1
rather	1
wigwam	1
pitched	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
main	1
mast	1
it	1
seemed	1
only	1
a	1
temporary	1
erection	1
used	1
in	1
port	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
conical	1
shape	1
some	1
ten	1
feet	1
high	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
huge	1
slabs	1
of	1
limber	1
black	1
bone	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
and	1
highest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
planted	1
with	1
their	1
broad	1
ends	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
these	1
slabs	1
laced	1
together	1
mutually	1
sloped	1
towards	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
apex	1
united	1
in	1
a	1
tufted	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
loose	1
hairy	1
fibres	1
waved	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
the	1
top	1
knot	1
on	1
some	1
old	1
pottowottamie	1
sachem	1
s	1
head	1
a	1
triangular	1
opening	1
faced	1
towards	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
insider	1
commanded	1
a	1
complete	1
view	1
forward	1
	1
and	1
half	1
concealed	1
in	1
this	1
queer	1
tenement	1
i	1
at	1
length	1
found	1
one	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
aspect	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
authority	1
and	1
who	1
it	1
being	1
noon	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
work	1
suspended	1
was	1
now	1
enjoying	1
respite	1
from	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
command	1
he	1
was	1
seated	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
fashioned	1
oaken	1
chair	1
wriggling	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
curious	1
carving	1
and	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
formed	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
interlacing	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
elastic	1
stuff	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
wigwam	1
was	1
constructed	1
	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
so	1
very	1
particular	1
perhaps	1
about	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
elderly	1
man	1
i	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
brown	1
and	1
brawny	1
like	1
most	1
old	1
seamen	1
and	1
heavily	1
rolled	1
up	1
in	1
blue	1
pilot	1
cloth	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
quaker	1
style	1
only	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
and	1
almost	1
microscopic	1
net	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
minutest	1
wrinkles	1
interlacing	1
round	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
arisen	1
from	1
his	1
continual	1
sailings	1
in	1
many	1
hard	1
gales	1
and	1
always	1
looking	1
to	1
windward	1
for	1
this	1
causes	1
the	1
muscles	1
about	1
the	1
eyes	1
to	1
become	1
pursed	1
together	1
such	1
eye	1
wrinkles	1
are	1
very	1
effectual	1
in	1
a	1
scowl	1
	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
said	1
i	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
	1
supposing	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
want	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
demanded	1
	1
i	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
shipping	1
	1

	1
no	1

i	1
never	1

	1

nothing	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
whaling	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
eh	1
	1
nothing	1
sir	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
i	1
shall	1
soon	1
learn	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
several	1
voyages	1
in	1
the	1
merchant	1
service	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
	1
merchant	1
service	1
be	1
damned	1
talk	1
not	1
that	1
lingo	1
to	1
me	1
dost	1
see	1
that	1
leg	1
i	1
ll	1
take	1
that	1
leg	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
stern	1
if	1
ever	1
thou	1
talkest	1
of	1
the	1
marchant	1
service	1
to	1
me	1
again	1
marchant	1
service	1
indeed	1
i	1
suppose	1
now	1
ye	1
feel	1
considerable	1
proud	1
of	1
having	1
served	1
in	1
those	1
marchant	1
ships	1
but	1
flukes	1
man	1
what	1
makes	1
thee	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whaling	1
eh	1
it	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
suspicious	1
don	1
t	1
it	1
eh	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
pirate	1
hast	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
rob	1
thy	1
last	1
captain	1
didst	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
murdering	1
the	1
officers	1
when	1
thou	1
gettest	1
to	1
sea	1
	1
i	1
protested	1
my	1
innocence	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
mask	1
of	1
these	1
half	1
humorous	1
innuendoes	1
this	1
old	1
seaman	1
as	1
an	1
insulated	1
quakerish	1
nantucketer	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
insular	1
prejudices	1
and	1
rather	1
distrustful	1
of	1
all	1
aliens	1
unless	1
they	1
hailed	1
from	1
cape	1
cod	1
or	1
the	1
vineyard	1
	1
but	1
what	1
takes	1
thee	1
a	1
whaling	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
before	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
shipping	1
ye	1
	1
well	1
sir	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
whaling	1
is	1

what	1

ye	1
clapped	1
eye	1
on	1
captain	1
ahab	1
	1
who	1
is	1
captain	1
ahab	1
sir	1
	1
aye	1
aye	1
i	1
thought	1
so	1
captain	1
ahab	1
is	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
this	1
ship	1
	1
i	1
am	1
mistaken	1
then	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
himself	1
	1
thou	1
art	1
speaking	1
to	1
captain	1
peleg	1
that	1
s	1
who	1
ye	1
are	1
speaking	1
to	1
young	1
man	1
it	1
belongs	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
captain	1
bildad	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
pequod	1
fitted	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
and	1
supplied	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
needs	1
including	1
crew	1
we	1
are	1
part	1
owners	1
and	1
agents	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
if	1
thou	1
wantest	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
whaling	1
is	1
as	1
thou	1
tellest	1
ye	1
do	1
i	1
can	1
put	1
ye	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
finding	1
it	1
out	1
before	1
ye	1
bind	1
yourself	1
to	1
it	1
past	1
backing	1
out	1
clap	1
eye	1
on	1
captain	1
ahab	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
leg	1
	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
sir	1
was	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
lost	1
by	1
a	1
whale	1
	1
lost	1
by	1
a	1
whale	1
young	1
man	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
devoured	1
chewed	1
up	1
crunched	1
by	1
the	1
monstrousest	1
parmacetty	1
that	1
ever	1
chipped	1
a	1
boat	1
ah	1
ah	1
	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
alarmed	1
by	1
his	1
energy	1
perhaps	1
also	1
a	1
little	1
touched	1
at	1
the	1
hearty	1
grief	1
in	1
his	1
concluding	1
exclamation	1
but	1
said	1
as	1
calmly	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
true	1
enough	1
sir	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
know	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
peculiar	1
ferocity	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
whale	1
though	1
indeed	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
inferred	1
as	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
simple	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
accident	1
	1
look	1
ye	1
now	1
young	1
man	1
thy	1
lungs	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
soft	1
d	1
ye	1
see	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
talk	1
shark	1
a	1
bit	1
sure	1
ye	1
ve	1
been	1
to	1
sea	1
before	1
now	1
sure	1
of	1
that	1
	1
sir	1
said	1
i	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
four	1
voyages	1
in	1
the	1
merchant	1
	1
hard	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
mind	1
what	1
i	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
marchant	1
service	1
don	1
t	1
aggravate	1
me	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
have	1
it	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
i	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
hint	1
about	1
what	1
whaling	1
is	1
do	1
ye	1
yet	1
feel	1
inclined	1
for	1
it	1
	1
i	1
do	1
sir	1
	1
very	1
good	1
now	1
art	1
thou	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
pitch	1
a	1
harpoon	1
down	1
a	1
live	1
whale	1
s	1
throat	1
and	1
then	1
jump	1
after	1
it	1
answer	1
quick	1
	1
i	1
am	1
sir	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
positively	1
indispensable	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
is	1
which	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fact	1
	1
good	1
again	1
now	1
then	1
thou	1
not	1
only	1
wantest	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whaling	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
by	1
experience	1
what	1
whaling	1
is	1
but	1
ye	1
also	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
what	1
ye	1
said	1
i	1
thought	1
so	1
well	1
then	1
just	1
step	1
forward	1
there	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
peep	1
over	1
the	1
weather	1
bow	1
and	1
then	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
ye	1
see	1
there	1
	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
puzzled	1
by	1
this	1
curious	1
request	1
not	1
knowing	1
exactly	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
whether	1
humorously	1
or	1
in	1
earnest	1
but	1
concentrating	1
all	1
his	1
crow	1
s	1
feet	1
into	1
one	1
scowl	1
captain	1
peleg	1
started	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
errand	1
	1
going	1
forward	1
and	1
glancing	1
over	1
the	1
weather	1
bow	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
swinging	1
to	1
her	1
anchor	1
with	1
the	1
flood	1
tide	1
was	1
now	1
obliquely	1
pointing	1
towards	1
the	1
open	1
ocean	1
the	1
prospect	1
was	1
unlimited	1
but	1
exceedingly	1
monotonous	1
and	1
forbidding	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
variety	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
	1
well	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
report	1
said	1
peleg	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
what	1
did	1
ye	1
see	1
	1
not	1
much	1
i	1
replied	1
nothing	1
but	1
water	1
considerable	1
horizon	1
though	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
squall	1
coming	1
up	1
i	1
think	1
	1
well	1
what	1
does	1
thou	1
think	1
then	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
world	1
do	1
ye	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
cape	1
horn	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
eh	1
can	1
t	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
you	1
stand	1
	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
staggered	1
but	1
go	1
a	1
whaling	1
i	1
must	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
and	1
the	1
pequod	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
ship	1
as	1
any	1
i	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
i	1
now	1
repeated	1
to	1
peleg	1
seeing	1
me	1
so	1
determined	1
he	1
expressed	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
ship	1
me	1
	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
as	1
well	1
sign	1
the	1
papers	1
right	1
off	1
he	1
added	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
ye	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
below	1
deck	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
transom	1
was	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
most	1
uncommon	1
and	1
surprising	1
figure	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
bildad	1
who	1
along	1
with	1
captain	1
peleg	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
the	1
other	1
shares	1
as	1
is	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
these	1
ports	1
being	1
held	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
old	1
annuitants	1
widows	1
fatherless	1
children	1
and	1
chancery	1
wards	1
each	1
owning	1
about	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
timber	1
head	1
or	1
a	1
foot	1
of	1
plank	1
or	1
a	1
nail	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
people	1
in	1
nantucket	1
invest	1
their	1
money	1
in	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
yours	1
in	1
approved	1
state	1
stocks	1
bringing	1
in	1
good	1
interest	1
	1
now	1
bildad	1
like	1
peleg	1
and	1
indeed	1
many	1
other	1
nantucketers	1
was	1
a	1
quaker	1
the	1
island	1
having	1
been	1
originally	1
settled	1
by	1
that	1
sect	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
its	1

only	1
results	1

a	1
well	1

cared	1
not	1

called	1
serious	1

indeed	1
deemed	1
those	1

veriest	1
of	1

originally	1

all	1

not	1

as	1
altered	1
one	1
angle	1
of	1
his	1

still	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
immutableness	1
was	1
there	1
some	1
lack	1
of	1
common	1
consistency	1
about	1
worthy	1
captain	1
peleg	1
though	1
refusing	1
from	1
conscientious	1
scruples	1
to	1
bear	1

against	1

himself	1

reminiscence	1

do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
concern	1
him	1
much	1
and	1
very	1
probably	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
sage	1
and	1
sensible	1
conclusion	1
that	1
a	1

i	1
hinted	1
before	1
had	1
concluded	1
his	1
adventurous	1
career	1
by	1
wholly	1
retiring	1
from	1
active	1
life	1
at	1
the	1
goodly	1
age	1
of	1
sixty	1

dedicating	1
his	1
remaining	1

to	1
the	1
quiet	1

of	1
his	1
well	1
earned	1
income	1
	1
now	1
bildad	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
incorrigible	1
old	1
hunks	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sea	1
going	1
days	1
a	1
bitter	1
hard	1
task	1
master	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
nantucket	1
though	1
it	1
certainly	1
seems	1
a	1
curious	1
story	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
sailed	1
the	1
old	1
categut	1
whaleman	1
his	1
crew	1
upon	1
arriving	1
home	1
were	1
mostly	1
all	1
carried	1
ashore	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
sore	1
exhausted	1
and	1
worn	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
pious	1
man	1
especially	1
for	1
a	1
quaker	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
hard	1
hearted	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
least	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
swear	1
though	1
at	1
his	1
men	1
they	1
said	1
but	1
somehow	1
he	1
got	1
an	1
inordinate	1
quantity	1
of	1
cruel	1
unmitigated	1
hard	1
work	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
bildad	1
was	1
a	1
chief	1
mate	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
drab	1
coloured	1
eye	1
intently	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
made	1
you	1
feel	1
completely	1
nervous	1
till	1
you	1
could	1
clutch	1
something	1
a	1
hammer	1
or	1
a	1
marling	1
spike	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
work	1
like	1
mad	1
at	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
never	1
mind	1
what	1
indolence	1
and	1
idleness	1
perished	1
before	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
was	1
the	1
exact	1
embodiment	1
of	1
his	1
utilitarian	1
character	1
on	1
his	1
long	1
gaunt	1
body	1
he	1
carried	1
no	1
spare	1
flesh	1
no	1
superfluous	1
beard	1
his	1
chin	1
having	1
a	1
soft	1
economical	1
nap	1
to	1
it	1
like	1
the	1
worn	1
nap	1
of	1
his	1
broad	1
brimmed	1
hat	1
	1
such	1
then	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
that	1
i	1
saw	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
transom	1
when	1
i	1
followed	1
captain	1
peleg	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
decks	1
was	1
small	1
and	1
there	1
bolt	1
upright	1
sat	1
old	1
bildad	1
who	1
always	1
sat	1
so	1
and	1
never	1
leaned	1
and	1
this	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
coat	1
tails	1
his	1
broad	1
brim	1
was	1
placed	1
beside	1
him	1
his	1
legs	1
were	1
stiffly	1
crossed	1
his	1
drab	1
vesture	1
was	1
buttoned	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chin	1
and	1
spectacles	1
on	1
nose	1
he	1
seemed	1
absorbed	1
in	1
reading	1
from	1
a	1
ponderous	1
volume	1
	1
bildad	1
cried	1
captain	1
peleg	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
bildad	1
eh	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
studying	1
those	1
scriptures	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
thirty	1
years	1
to	1
my	1
certain	1
knowledge	1
how	1
far	1
ye	1
got	1
bildad	1
	1
as	1
if	1
long	1
habituated	1
to	1
such	1
profane	1
talk	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
shipmate	1
bildad	1
without	1
noticing	1
his	1
present	1
irreverence	1
quietly	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
me	1
glanced	1
again	1
inquiringly	1
towards	1
peleg	1
	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
s	1
our	1
man	1
bildad	1
said	1
peleg	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
ship	1
	1
dost	1
thee	1
said	1
bildad	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
tone	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
me	1
	1
i	1
dost	1
said	1
i	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
a	1
quaker	1
	1
what	1
do	1
ye	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
bildad	1
said	1
peleg	1
	1
he	1
ll	1
do	1
said	1
bildad	1
eyeing	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
spelling	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
in	1
a	1
mumbling	1
tone	1
quite	1
audible	1
	1
i	1
thought	1
him	1
the	1
queerest	1
old	1
quaker	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
especially	1
as	1
peleg	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
old	1
shipmate	1
seemed	1
such	1
a	1
blusterer	1
but	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
only	1
looking	1
round	1
me	1
sharply	1
peleg	1
now	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
chest	1
and	1
drawing	1
forth	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
articles	1
placed	1
pen	1
and	1
ink	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
myself	1
at	1
what	1
terms	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
engage	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
i	1
was	1
already	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
whaling	1
business	1
they	1
paid	1
no	1
wages	1
but	1
all	1
hands	1
including	1
the	1
captain	1
received	1
certain	1
shares	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
called	1
lays	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
lays	1
were	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
respective	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
company	1
i	1
was	1
also	1
aware	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
green	1
hand	1
at	1
whaling	1
my	1
own	1
lay	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
large	1
but	1
considering	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
could	1
steer	1
a	1
ship	1
splice	1
a	1
rope	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
made	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
from	1
all	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
275th	1
lay	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
275th	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
clear	1
net	1
proceeds	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
whatever	1
that	1
might	1
eventually	1
amount	1
to	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
275th	1
lay	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
a	1
rather	1
long	1
lay	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
nothing	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
lucky	1
voyage	1
might	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
clothing	1
i	1
would	1
wear	1
out	1
on	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
three	1
years	1
beef	1
and	1
board	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
one	1
stiver	1
	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
way	1
to	1
accumulate	1
a	1
princely	1
fortune	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
way	1
indeed	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
never	1
take	1
on	1
about	1
princely	1
fortunes	1
and	1
am	1
quite	1
content	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
board	1
and	1
lodge	1
me	1
while	1
i	1
am	1
putting	1
up	1
at	1
this	1
grim	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
thunder	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
275th	1
lay	1
would	1
be	1
about	1
the	1
fair	1
thing	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
had	1
i	1
been	1
offered	1
the	1
200th	1
considering	1
i	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
make	1
	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
nevertheless	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
distrustful	1
about	1
receiving	1
a	1
generous	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
was	1
this	1
ashore	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
something	1
of	1
both	1
captain	1
peleg	1
and	1
his	1
unaccountable	1
old	1
crony	1
bildad	1
how	1
that	1
they	1
being	1
the	1
principal	1
proprietors	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
therefore	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
more	1
inconsiderable	1
and	1
scattered	1
owners	1
left	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
affairs	1
to	1
these	1
two	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
what	1
the	1
stingy	1
old	1
bildad	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
mighty	1
deal	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
shipping	1
hands	1
especially	1
as	1
i	1
now	1
found	1
him	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
pequod	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
and	1
reading	1
his	1
bible	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
fireside	1
now	1
while	1
peleg	1
was	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
mend	1
a	1
pen	1
with	1
his	1
jack	1
knife	1
old	1
bildad	1
to	1
my	1
no	1
small	1
surprise	1
considering	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
interested	1
party	1
in	1
these	1
proceedings	1
bildad	1
never	1
heeded	1
us	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
mumbling	1
to	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
lay	1
not	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
upon	1
earth	1
where	1

give	1
this	1
young	1

after	1

nothing	1

that	1

that	1
the	1

i	1
had	1
not	1

me	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
sail	1

remained	1
unseen	1
by	1
me	1

indeed	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
will	1
be	1
completely	1
fitted	1
out	1
and	1
receive	1
all	1
her	1
crew	1
on	1
board	1
ere	1
the	1

makes	1
himself	1
visible	1
by	1
arriving	1
to	1
take	1
command	1
for	1
sometimes	1
these	1
voyages	1
are	1
so	1
prolonged	1
and	1
the	1
shore	1
intervals	1
at	1
home	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
brief	1
that	1
if	1
the	1

any	1
absorbing	1
concernment	1
of	1
that	1

himself	1
much	1
about	1
his	1

is	1
ready	1

however	1
it	1
is	1

have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
before	1
irrevocably	1
committing	1
yourself	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
turning	1
back	1
i	1
accosted	1

at	1

the	1
cruel	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
also	1
felt	1
a	1
strange	1
awe	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
awe	1
which	1
i	1
cannot	1
at	1
all	1
describe	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
awe	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
i	1
felt	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
disincline	1
me	1
towards	1
him	1
though	1
i	1
felt	1
impatience	1
at	1
what	1
seemed	1
like	1
mystery	1
in	1
him	1
so	1
imperfectly	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
however	1
my	1
thoughts	1
were	1
at	1
length	1
carried	1
in	1
other	1
directions	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
dark	1
ahab	1
slipped	1
my	1
mind	1
	1
	1

the	1
ramadan	1
	1
	1
as	1
queequeg	1
s	1
ramadan	1
or	1
fasting	1
and	1
humiliation	1
was	1
to	1
continue	1
all	1
day	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
disturb	1
him	1
till	1
towards	1
night	1
fall	1
for	1
i	1
cherish	1
the	1
greatest	1
respect	1
towards	1
everybody	1
s	1
religious	1
obligations	1
never	1
mind	1
how	1
comical	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
undervalue	1
even	1
a	1
congregation	1
of	1
ants	1
worshipping	1
a	1
toad	1
stool	1
or	1
those	1
other	1
creatures	1
in	1
certain	1
parts	1
of	1
our	1
earth	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
footmanism	1
quite	1
unprecedented	1
in	1
other	1
planets	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
torso	1
of	1
a	1
deceased	1
landed	1
proprietor	1
merely	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
inordinate	1
possessions	1
yet	1
owned	1
and	1
rented	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
	1
i	1
say	1
we	1
good	1
presbyterian	1
christians	1
should	1
be	1
charitable	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
not	1
fancy	1
ourselves	1
so	1
vastly	1
superior	1
to	1
other	1
mortals	1
pagans	1
and	1
what	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
half	1
crazy	1
conceits	1
on	1
these	1
subjects	1
there	1
was	1
queequeg	1
now	1
certainly	1
entertaining	1
the	1
most	1
absurd	1
notions	1
about	1
yojo	1
and	1
his	1
ramadan	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
that	1
queequeg	1
thought	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
and	1
there	1
let	1
him	1
rest	1
all	1
our	1
arguing	1
with	1
him	1
would	1
not	1
avail	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
i	1
say	1
and	1
heaven	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
presbyterians	1
and	1
pagans	1
alike	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
somehow	1
dreadfully	1
cracked	1
about	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
sadly	1
need	1
mending	1
	1
towards	1
evening	1
when	1
i	1
felt	1
assured	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
performances	1
and	1
rituals	1
must	1
be	1
over	1
i	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
no	1
answer	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
fastened	1
inside	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
softly	1
through	1
the	1
key	1
hole	1
all	1
silent	1
i	1
say	1
queequeg	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
speak	1
it	1
s	1
i	1
ishmael	1
but	1
all	1
remained	1
still	1
as	1
before	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
alarmed	1
i	1
had	1
allowed	1
him	1
such	1
abundant	1
time	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
apoplectic	1
fit	1
i	1
looked	1
through	1
the	1
key	1
hole	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
opening	1
into	1
an	1
odd	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
key	1
hole	1
prospect	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
sinister	1
one	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
foot	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
but	1
nothing	1
more	1
i	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
behold	1
resting	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
the	1
wooden	1
shaft	1
of	1
queequeg	1
s	1
harpoon	1
which	1
the	1
landlady	1
the	1
evening	1
previous	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
him	1
before	1
our	1
mounting	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
that	1
s	1
strange	1
thought	1
i	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
since	1
the	1
harpoon	1
stands	1
yonder	1
and	1
he	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
goes	1
abroad	1
without	1
it	1
therefore	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
inside	1
here	1
and	1
no	1
possible	1
mistake	1
	1
queequeg	1
queequeg	1
all	1
still	1
something	1
must	1
have	1
happened	1
apoplexy	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
burst	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
it	1
stubbornly	1
resisted	1
running	1
down	1
stairs	1
i	1
quickly	1
stated	1
my	1
suspicions	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
i	1
met	1
the	1
chamber	1
maid	1
la	1
la	1
she	1
cried	1
i	1
thought	1
something	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
matter	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
bed	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
locked	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
mouse	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
been	1
just	1
so	1
silent	1
ever	1
since	1
but	1
i	1
thought	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
had	1
both	1
gone	1
off	1
and	1
locked	1
your	1
baggage	1
in	1

and	1
with	1
these	1
cries	1
she	1
ran	1
towards	1
the	1
kitchen	1
i	1
following	1
	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
soon	1
appeared	1
with	1
a	1
mustard	1
pot	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
vinegar	1
cruet	1
in	1
the	1

having	1
just	1
broken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
castors	1

upon	1

and	1
so	1
saying	1
i	1
was	1
unmethodically	1
rushing	1
up	1
stairs	1
again	1
empty	1
handed	1
when	1
mrs	1

interposed	1
the	1
mustard	1

the	1
landlady	1
quickly	1
putting	1
down	1
the	1
vinegar	1
cruet	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
one	1

about	1

possible	1
i	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
whole	1
case	1
unconsciously	1
clapping	1
the	1
vinegar	1
cruet	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nose	1

ruminated	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1

exclaimed	1

under	1

in	1

up	1

said	1
i	1
and	1
was	1
running	1
down	1
the	1
entry	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
start	1
when	1
the	1
landlady	1
caught	1
at	1
me	1
again	1
vowing	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
break	1
down	1
her	1
premises	1
but	1
i	1
tore	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
bodily	1
rush	1
dashed	1
myself	1
full	1
against	1
the	1
mark	1
	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
noise	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open	1
and	1
the	1
knob	1
slamming	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
sent	1
the	1
plaster	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
there	1
good	1
heavens	1
there	1
sat	1
queequeg	1
altogether	1
cool	1
and	1
self	1
collected	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
squatting	1
on	1
his	1
hams	1
and	1
holding	1
yojo	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
looked	1
neither	1
one	1
way	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
but	1
sat	1
like	1
a	1
carved	1
image	1
with	1
scarce	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
active	1
life	1
	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
queequeg	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
	1
he	1
hain	1
t	1
been	1
a	1
sittin	1
so	1
all	1
day	1
has	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
landlady	1
	1
but	1
all	1
we	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
could	1
we	1
drag	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
almost	1
felt	1
like	1
pushing	1
him	1
over	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
position	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
intolerable	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
painfully	1
and	1
unnaturally	1
constrained	1
especially	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
so	1
for	1
upwards	1
of	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
hours	1
going	1
too	1
without	1
his	1
regular	1
meals	1
	1
mrs	1
hussey	1
said	1
i	1
he	1
s	1
alive	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
so	1
leave	1
us	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
see	1
to	1
this	1
strange	1
affair	1
myself	1
	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
the	1
landlady	1
i	1
endeavored	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
queequeg	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
chair	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
all	1
my	1
polite	1
arts	1
and	1
blandishments	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
move	1
a	1
peg	1
nor	1
say	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
nor	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
nor	1
notice	1
my	1
presence	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
way	1
	1
i	1
wonder	1
thought	1
i	1
if	1
this	1
can	1
possibly	1
be	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
ramadan	1
do	1
they	1
fast	1
on	1
their	1
hams	1
that	1
way	1
in	1
his	1
native	1
island	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
creed	1
i	1
suppose	1
well	1
then	1
let	1
him	1
rest	1
he	1
ll	1
get	1
up	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
last	1
for	1
ever	1
thank	1
god	1
and	1
his	1
ramadan	1
only	1
comes	1
once	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
punctual	1
then	1
	1
i	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
supper	1
after	1
sitting	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
long	1
stories	1
of	1
some	1
sailors	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
plum	1
pudding	1
voyage	1
as	1
they	1
called	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
in	1
a	1
schooner	1
or	1
brig	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
the	1
atlantic	1
ocean	1
only	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
these	1
plum	1
puddingers	1
till	1
nearly	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
i	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
feeling	1
quite	1
sure	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
queequeg	1
must	1
certainly	1
have	1
brought	1
his	1
ramadan	1
to	1
a	1
termination	1
but	1
no	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
stirred	1
an	1
inch	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
vexed	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
so	1
downright	1
senseless	1
and	1
insane	1
to	1
be	1
sitting	1
there	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
his	1
hams	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
room	1
holding	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
wood	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
queequeg	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
shake	1
yourself	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
have	1
some	1
supper	1
you	1

starve	1
you	1
ll	1
kill	1
yourself	1
queequeg	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
did	1
he	1
reply	1
	1
despairing	1
of	1
him	1
therefore	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
before	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
me	1
but	1
previous	1
to	1
turning	1
in	1
i	1
took	1
my	1
heavy	1
bearskin	1
jacket	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
over	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
cold	1
night	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
ordinary	1
round	1
jacket	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
do	1
all	1
i	1
would	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
faintest	1
doze	1
i	1
had	1
blown	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
queequeg	1
not	1
four	1
feet	1
off	1
sitting	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
uneasy	1
position	1
stark	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
dark	1
this	1
made	1
me	1
really	1
wretched	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
sleeping	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
awake	1
pagan	1
on	1
his	1
hams	1
in	1
this	1
dreary	1
unaccountable	1
ramadan	1
	1
but	1
somehow	1
i	1
dropped	1
off	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing	1
more	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day	1
when	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
bedside	1
there	1
squatted	1
queequeg	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
screwed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
glimpse	1
of	1
sun	1
entered	1
the	1
window	1
up	1
he	1
got	1
with	1
stiff	1
and	1
grating	1
joints	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
look	1
limped	1
towards	1
me	1
where	1
i	1
lay	1
pressed	1
his	1
forehead	1
again	1
against	1
mine	1
and	1
said	1
his	1
ramadan	1
was	1
over	1
	1
now	1
as	1
i	1
before	1
hinted	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
any	1
person	1
s	1
religion	1
be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
that	1
person	1
does	1
not	1
kill	1
or	1
insult	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
because	1
that	1
other	1
person	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
also	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
religion	1
becomes	1
really	1
frantic	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
positive	1
torment	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
makes	1
this	1
earth	1
of	1
ours	1
an	1
uncomfortable	1
inn	1
to	1
lodge	1
in	1
then	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
individual	1
aside	1
and	1
argue	1
the	1
point	1
with	1
him	1
	1
and	1
just	1
so	1
i	1
now	1
did	1
with	1
queequeg	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
get	1
into	1
bed	1
now	1
and	1
lie	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
rise	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
primitive	1
religions	1
and	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
religions	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
during	1
which	1
time	1
i	1
labored	1
to	1
show	1
queequeg	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
lents	1
ramadans	1
and	1
prolonged	1
ham	1
squattings	1
in	1
cold	1
cheerless	1
rooms	1
were	1
stark	1
nonsense	1
bad	1
for	1
the	1
health	1
useless	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
opposed	1
in	1
short	1
to	1
the	1
obvious	1
laws	1
of	1
hygiene	1
and	1
common	1
sense	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
being	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
such	1
an	1
extremely	1
sensible	1
and	1
sagacious	1
savage	1
it	1
pained	1
me	1
very	1
badly	1
pained	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
now	1
so	1
deplorably	1
foolish	1
about	1
this	1
ridiculous	1
ramadan	1
of	1
his	1
besides	1
argued	1
i	1
fasting	1
makes	1
the	1
body	1
cave	1
in	1
hence	1
the	1
spirit	1
caves	1
in	1
and	1
all	1
thoughts	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
fast	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
half	1
starved	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
most	1
dyspeptic	1
religionists	1
cherish	1
such	1
melancholy	1
notions	1
about	1
their	1
hereafters	1
in	1
one	1
word	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
rather	1
digressively	1
hell	1
is	1
an	1
idea	1
first	1
born	1
on	1
an	1
undigested	1
apple	1
dumpling	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
perpetuated	1
through	1
the	1
hereditary	1
dyspepsias	1
nurtured	1
by	1
ramadans	1
	1
i	1
then	1
asked	1
queequeg	1
whether	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
ever	1
troubled	1
with	1
dyspepsia	1
expressing	1
the	1
idea	1
very	1
plainly	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
only	1
upon	1
one	1
memorable	1
occasion	1
it	1
was	1
after	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
given	1
by	1
his	1
father	1
the	1
king	1
on	1
the	1
gaining	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
wherein	1
fifty	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
by	1
about	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
all	1
cooked	1
and	1
eaten	1
that	1
very	1
evening	1
	1
no	1
more	1
queequeg	1
said	1
i	1
shuddering	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
inferences	1
without	1
his	1
further	1
hinting	1
them	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
sailor	1
who	1
had	1
visited	1
that	1
very	1
island	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
when	1
a	1
great	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
gained	1
there	1
to	1
barbecue	1
all	1
the	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
or	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
victor	1
and	1
then	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
they	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
great	1
wooden	1
trenchers	1
and	1
garnished	1
round	1
like	1
a	1
pilau	1
with	1
breadfruit	1
and	1
cocoanuts	1
and	1
with	1
some	1
parsley	1
in	1
their	1
mouths	1
were	1
sent	1
round	1
with	1
the	1
victor	1
s	1
compliments	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
these	1
presents	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
christmas	1
turkeys	1
	1
after	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
my	1
remarks	1
about	1
religion	1
made	1
much	1
impression	1
upon	1
queequeg	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing	1
on	1
that	1
important	1
subject	1
unless	1
considered	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
place	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
understand	1
me	1
couch	1
my	1
ideas	1
simply	1
as	1
i	1
would	1
and	1
finally	1
he	1
no	1
doubt	1
thought	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
true	1
religion	1
than	1
i	1
did	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
condescending	1
concern	1
and	1
compassion	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
sensible	1
young	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
lost	1
to	1
evangelical	1
pagan	1
piety	1
	1
at	1
last	1
we	1
rose	1
and	1
dressed	1
and	1
queequeg	1
taking	1
a	1
prodigiously	1
hearty	1
breakfast	1
of	1
chowders	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
landlady	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
much	1
profit	1
by	1
reason	1

thought	1
i	1
and	1
we	1
walked	1
away	1
both	1
commenting	1
after	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
fashion	1
upon	1
this	1
ragged	1
old	1
sailor	1
and	1
agreed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
humbug	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
bugbear	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
perhaps	1
above	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
when	1
chancing	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
elijah	1
following	1
us	1
though	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
somehow	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
struck	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
queequeg	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
behind	1
but	1
passed	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
comrade	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
stranger	1
would	1
turn	1
the	1
same	1
corner	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
he	1
did	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dogging	1
us	1
but	1
with	1
what	1
intent	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
me	1
imagine	1
this	1
circumstance	1
coupled	1
with	1
his	1
ambiguous	1
half	1
hinting	1
half	1
revealing	1
shrouded	1
sort	1
of	1
talk	1
now	1
begat	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
vague	1
wonderments	1
and	1
half	1
apprehensions	1
and	1
all	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
pequod	1
and	1
captain	1
ahab	1
and	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
and	1
the	1
cape	1
horn	1
fit	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
calabash	1
and	1
what	1
captain	1
peleg	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
day	1
previous	1
and	1
the	1
prediction	1
of	1
the	1
squaw	1
tistig	1
and	1
the	1
voyage	1
we	1
had	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
to	1
sail	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
shadowy	1
things	1
	1
i	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
whether	1
this	1
ragged	1
elijah	1
was	1
really	1
dogging	1
us	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
intent	1
crossed	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
queequeg	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
retraced	1
our	1
steps	1
but	1
elijah	1
passed	1
on	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
notice	1
us	1
this	1
relieved	1
me	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
finally	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1

	1
	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
activity	1
aboard	1
the	1
pequod	1
not	1
only	1
were	1
the	1
old	1
sails	1
being	1
mended	1
but	1
new	1
sails	1
were	1
coming	1
on	1
board	1
and	1
bolts	1
of	1
canvas	1
and	1
coils	1
of	1
rigging	1
in	1
short	1
everything	1
betokened	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
preparations	1
were	1
hurrying	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
captain	1
peleg	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
went	1
ashore	1
but	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
wigwam	1
keeping	1
a	1
sharp	1
look	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
hands	1
bildad	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
purchasing	1
and	1
providing	1
at	1
the	1
stores	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
rigging	1
were	1
working	1
till	1
long	1
after	1
night	1
fall	1
	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
queequeg	1
s	1
signing	1
the	1
articles	1
word	1
was	1
given	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
inns	1
where	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
company	1
were	1
stopping	1
that	1
their	1
chests	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
board	1
before	1
night	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
telling	1
how	1
soon	1
the	1
vessel	1
might	1
be	1
sailing	1
so	1
queequeg	1
and	1
i	1
got	1
down	1
our	1
traps	1
resolving	1
however	1
to	1
sleep	1
ashore	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
they	1
always	1
give	1
very	1
long	1
notice	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
did	1
not	1
sail	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
but	1
no	1
wonder	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
before	1
the	1
pequod	1
was	1
fully	1
equipped	1
	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
what	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
things	1
beds	1
sauce	1
pans	1
knives	1
and	1
forks	1
shovels	1
and	1
tongs	1
napkins	1
nut	1
crackers	1
and	1
what	1
not	1
are	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
housekeeping	1
just	1
so	1
with	1
whaling	1
which	1
necessitates	1
a	1
three	1
years	1
housekeeping	1
upon	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean	1
far	1
from	1
all	1
grocers	1
costermongers	1
doctors	1
bakers	1
and	1
bankers	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
also	1
holds	1
true	1
of	1
merchant	1
vessels	1
yet	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
extent	1
as	1
with	1
whalemen	1
for	1
besides	1
the	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
the	1
numerous	1
articles	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
and	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
replacing	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
remote	1
harbors	1
usually	1
frequented	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
ships	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
exposed	1
to	1
accidents	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
destruction	1
and	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
things	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
most	1
depends	1
hence	1
the	1
spare	1
boats	1
spare	1
spars	1
and	1
spare	1
lines	1
and	1
harpoons	1
and	1
spare	1
everythings	1
almost	1
but	1
a	1
spare	1
captain	1
and	1
duplicate	1
ship	1
	1
at	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
our	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
island	1
the	1
heaviest	1
storage	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
completed	1
comprising	1
her	1
beef	1
bread	1
water	1
fuel	1
and	1
iron	1
hoops	1
and	1
staves	1
but	1
as	1
before	1
hinted	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
fetching	1
and	1
carrying	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
divers	1
odds	1
and	1
ends	1
of	1
things	1
both	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
	1
chief	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
this	1
fetching	1
and	1
carrying	1
was	1
captain	1
bildad	1
s	1
sister	1
a	1
lean	1
old	1
lady	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
determined	1
and	1
indefatigable	1
spirit	1
but	1
withal	1
very	1
kindhearted	1
who	1
seemed	1
resolved	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
help	1
it	1
nothing	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
wanting	1
in	1
the	1
pequod	1
after	1
once	1
fairly	1
getting	1
to	1
sea	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
with	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
pickles	1
for	1
the	1
steward	1
s	1
pantry	1
another	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
quills	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
mate	1
s	1
desk	1
where	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
log	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
flannel	1
for	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
s	1
rheumatic	1
back	1
never	1
did	1
any	1
woman	1
better	1
deserve	1
her	1
name	1
which	1
was	1
charity	1
aunt	1
charity	1
as	1
everybody	1
called	1
her	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
charity	1
did	1
this	1
charitable	1
aunt	1
charity	1
bustle	1
about	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
heart	1
to	1
anything	1
that	1
promised	1
to	1
yield	1
safety	1
comfort	1
and	1
consolation	1
to	1
all	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
ship	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
beloved	1
brother	1
bildad	1
was	1
concerned	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
herself	1
owned	1
a	1
score	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
well	1
saved	1
dollars	1
	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
startling	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
excellent	1
hearted	1
quakeress	1
coming	1
on	1
board	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
oil	1
ladle	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
longer	1
whaling	1
lance	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
nor	1
was	1
bildad	1
himself	1
nor	1
captain	1
peleg	1
at	1
all	1
backward	1
as	1
for	1
bildad	1
he	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
long	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
needed	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
fresh	1
arrival	1
down	1
went	1
his	1
mark	1
opposite	1
that	1
article	1
upon	1
the	1
paper	1
every	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
while	1
peleg	1
came	1
hobbling	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
whalebone	1
den	1
roaring	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
down	1
the	1
hatchways	1
roaring	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
riggers	1
at	1
the	1
mast	1
head	1
and	1
then	1
concluded	1
by	1
roaring	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
wigwam	1
	1
during	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
preparation	1
queequeg	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
visited	1
the	1
craft	1
and	1
as	1
often	1
i	1
asked	1
about	1
captain	1
ahab	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
his	1
ship	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
they	1
would	1
answer	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
better	1
and	1
better	1
and	1
was	1
expected	1
aboard	1
every	1
day	1
meantime	1
the	1
two	1
captains	1
peleg	1
and	1
bildad	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
everything	1
necessary	1
to	1
fit	1
the	1
vessel	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
downright	1
honest	1
with	1
myself	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
very	1
plainly	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
but	1
half	1
fancy	1
being	1
committed	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
voyage	1
without	1
once	1
laying	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
absolute	1
dictator	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ship	1
sailed	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
suspects	1
any	1
wrong	1
it	1
sometimes	1
happens	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
already	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
he	1
insensibly	1
strives	1
to	1
cover	1
up	1
his	1
suspicions	1
even	1
from	1
himself	1
and	1
much	1
this	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
nothing	1
	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
out	1
that	1
some	1
time	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
ship	1
would	1
certainly	1
sail	1
so	1
next	1
morning	1
queequeg	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
start	1

a	1
voice	1
whose	1
owner	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
coming	1
close	1
behind	1
us	1
laid	1
a	1
hand	1
upon	1
both	1

and	1
then	1
insinuating	1
himself	1
between	1
us	1
stood	1
stooping	1
forward	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
uncertain	1

with	1

he	1
finally	1
departed	1

me	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
in	1
no	1
small	1
wonderment	1
at	1
his	1
frantic	1
impudence	1
	1
at	1
last	1
stepping	1
on	1
board	1
the	1

we	1
found	1
everything	1
in	1
profound	1
quiet	1
not	1
a	1

moving	1
the	1
cabin	1
entrance	1
was	1
locked	1
within	1
the	1

all	1
on	1
and	1
lumbered	1
with	1
coils	1
of	1
rigging	1
going	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
forecastle	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
slide	1
of	1
the	1
scuttle	1
open	1
seeing	1
a	1
light	1
we	1
went	1
down	1
and	1
found	1
only	1
an	1
old	1
rigger	1
there	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
tattered	1
pea	1
jacket	1
he	1
was	1
thrown	1
at	1
whole	1
length	1
upon	1
two	1
chests	1
his	1
face	1
downwards	1
and	1
inclosed	1
in	1
his	1
folded	1
arms	1
the	1
profoundest	1

upon	1
him	1
	1

i	1
looking	1
dubiously	1
at	1
the	1

it	1
seemed	1
that	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
wharf	1
queequeg	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
all	1

but	1
i	1
beat	1
the	1
thing	1
down	1
and	1
again	1
marking	1
the	1
sleeper	1
jocularly	1
hinted	1
to	1
queequeg	1
that	1
perhaps	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
sit	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
body	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
establish	1
himself	1
accordingly	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
sleeper	1

rear	1
as	1
though	1
feeling	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
soft	1
enough	1
and	1
then	1
without	1

himself	1
to	1
just	1
beyond	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
lighted	1
his	1
tomahawk	1
pipe	1
i	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
we	1
kept	1
the	1
pipe	1
passing	1
over	1
the	1
sleeper	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
meanwhile	1
upon	1
questioning	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
broken	1
fashion	1
queequeg	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
land	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
settees	1
and	1
sofas	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
the	1
king	1
chiefs	1
and	1
great	1
people	1
generally	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
fattening	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
orders	1
for	1
ottomans	1
and	1
to	1
furnish	1
a	1
house	1
comfortably	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
you	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
buy	1
up	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
lazy	1
fellows	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
piers	1
and	1
alcoves	1
besides	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
convenient	1
on	1
an	1
excursion	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
those	1
garden	1
chairs	1
which	1
are	1
convertible	1
into	1
walking	1
sticks	1
upon	1
occasion	1
a	1

desiring	1
him	1
to	1

of	1
himself	1
under	1
a	1

perhaps	1

he	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
some	1
wild	1
reminiscences	1
about	1
his	1
tomahawk	1

which	1
it	1

in	1
its	1
two	1

both	1

his	1

now	1
completely	1

with	1
a	1

of	1

seemed	1
troubled	1
in	1
the	1
nose	1
then	1
revolved	1
over	1

	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
to	1

some	1
further	1

concerning	1

noise	1
on	1

all	1

now	1
i	1
must	1
turn	1
to	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
deck	1
and	1
we	1
followed	1
	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
clear	1
sunrise	1
soon	1
the	1

came	1
on	1

in	1

the	1

bestirred	1
themselves	1
the	1

several	1
of	1
the	1

were	1
busy	1
in	1
bringing	1
various	1
last	1
things	1
on	1

upon	1
the	1

of	1

and	1
after	1
the	1

had	1
been	1
hauled	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
ever	1

charity	1
had	1
come	1
off	1
in	1

issued	1
from	1

and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1

said	1
	1
now	1
mr	1

are	1
you	1
sure	1
everything	1
is	1
right	1
captain	1
ahab	1
is	1
all	1
ready	1
just	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1

from	1

eh	1
well	1

	1
no	1

said	1

but	1
away	1
with	1
thee	1
friend	1
starbuck	1
and	1
do	1
our	1
bidding	1
	1
how	1
now	1
here	1
upon	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
starting	1
for	1
the	1
voyage	1
captain	1
peleg	1
and	1
captain	1
bildad	1
were	1
going	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
joint	1
commanders	1
at	1
sea	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
appearances	1
in	1
port	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
captain	1
ahab	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
only	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
idea	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
necessary	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1
ship	1
under	1
weigh	1
and	1
steering	1
her	1
well	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
indeed	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
proper	1
business	1
but	1
the	1
pilot	1
s	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
completely	1
recovered	1
so	1
they	1
said	1
therefore	1
captain	1
ahab	1
stayed	1
below	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
seemed	1
natural	1
enough	1
especially	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
merchant	1
service	1
many	1
captains	1
never	1
show	1
themselves	1
on	1
deck	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
after	1
heaving	1
up	1
the	1
anchor	1
but	1
remain	1
over	1
the	1
cabin	1
table	1
having	1
a	1
farewell	1
merry	1
making	1
with	1
their	1
shore	1
friends	1
before	1
they	1
quit	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
good	1
with	1
the	1
pilot	1
	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
chance	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
matter	1
for	1
captain	1
peleg	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
alive	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
talking	1
and	1
commanding	1
and	1
not	1
bildad	1
	1
aft	1

i	1
hinted	1
before	1
this	1
whalebone	1
marquee	1
was	1
never	1
pitched	1
except	1
in	1
port	1
and	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
pequod	1
for	1
thirty	1
years	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
tent	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
to	1
heaving	1
up	1
the	1

	1
man	1
the	1

the	1

	1
now	1
in	1
getting	1
under	1

the	1
station	1
generally	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
pilot	1
is	1
the	1
forward	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
here	1
bildad	1
who	1
with	1
peleg	1
be	1
it	1
known	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
officers	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
licensed	1
pilots	1
of	1
the	1

he	1
being	1
suspected	1
to	1
have	1

a	1
pilot	1
in	1

to	1
save	1
the	1
nantucket	1

fee	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ships	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
in	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
piloted	1
any	1
other	1
craft	1
bildad	1
i	1
say	1
might	1
now	1
be	1
seen	1
actively	1
engaged	1
in	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
bows	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
anchor	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
singing	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
dismal	1
stave	1
of	1
psalmody	1
to	1
cheer	1
the	1
hands	1
at	1
the	1
windlass	1
who	1
roared	1
forth	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
chorus	1
about	1
the	1
girls	1
in	1
booble	1
alley	1
with	1
hearty	1
good	1
will	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
three	1
days	1
previous	1
bildad	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
no	1
profane	1
songs	1
would	1
be	1
allowed	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
pequod	1
particularly	1
in	1
getting	1
under	1
weigh	1
and	1
charity	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
placed	1
a	1
small	1
choice	1
copy	1
of	1
watts	1
in	1
each	1
seaman	1
s	1
berth	1
	1
meantime	1
overseeing	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
captain	1
peleg	1
ripped	1
and	1
swore	1
astern	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
frightful	1
manner	1
i	1
almost	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
sink	1
the	1
ship	1
before	1
the	1
anchor	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
up	1
involuntarily	1
i	1
paused	1
on	1
my	1
handspike	1
and	1
told	1
queequeg	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
perils	1
we	1
both	1
ran	1
in	1
starting	1
on	1
the	1
voyage	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
devil	1
for	1
a	1
pilot	1
i	1
was	1
comforting	1
myself	1
however	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
pious	1
bildad	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
some	1
salvation	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy	1
seventh	1
lay	1
when	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
sharp	1
poke	1
in	1
my	1
rear	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
captain	1
peleg	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
leg	1
from	1

the	1

merged	1
into	1

we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
almost	1
broad	1
upon	1
the	1
wintry	1
ocean	1
whose	1
freezing	1
spray	1
cased	1
us	1
in	1

of	1

than	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
hope	1

not	1

how	1

affected	1
at	1
this	1

for	1
loath	1

very	1
loath	1
to	1

bound	1
on	1
so	1
long	1

perilous	1
a	1
voyage	1
beyond	1
both	1
stormy	1

a	1

in	1

some	1
thousands	1

long	1
paced	1

with	1
anxious	1

ran	1
down	1
into	1
the	1

to	1
speak	1
another	1

there	1
again	1
came	1
on	1

looked	1

bounded	1

at	1

mechanically	1
coiling	1
a	1

upon	1
its	1

convulsively	1
grasped	1

by	1
the	1

holding	1
up	1
a	1

for	1
a	1

for	1

there	1
was	1
a	1

as	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
has	1
somehow	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
among	1
landsmen	1
as	1
a	1
rather	1
unpoetical	1
and	1
disreputable	1
pursuit	1
therefore	1
i	1
am	1
all	1
anxiety	1
to	1
convince	1
ye	1
ye	1
landsmen	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
hereby	1
done	1
to	1
us	1
hunters	1
of	1
whales	1
	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
almost	1
superfluous	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
among	1
people	1
at	1
large	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
is	1
not	1
accounted	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
liberal	1
professions	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
were	1
introduced	1
into	1
any	1
miscellaneous	1
metropolitan	1
society	1
it	1
would	1
but	1
slightly	1
advance	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
merits	1
were	1
he	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
as	1
a	1
harpooneer	1
say	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
emulation	1
of	1
the	1
naval	1
officers	1
he	1
should	1
append	1
the	1
initials	1
s	1
w	1
f	1
sperm	1
whale	1
fishery	1
to	1
his	1
visiting	1
card	1
such	1
a	1
procedure	1
would	1
be	1
deemed	1
pre	1
eminently	1
presuming	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
	1
doubtless	1
one	1
leading	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
world	1
declines	1
honouring	1
us	1
whalemen	1
is	1
this	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
at	1
best	1
our	1
vocation	1
amounts	1
to	1
a	1
butchering	1
sort	1
of	1

certain	1

so	1
continuously	1

that	1

may	1
well	1

that	1

who	1
bore	1

contemptibly	1
a	1

palpably	1

of	1

a	1

the	1

thing	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
what	1

this	1

seemed	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
wasting	1

it	1
seemed	1
the	1

life	1
for	1
the	1

was	1
a	1

not	1

chapter	1
of	1

yet	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
hardy	1
sobriety	1
and	1
fortitude	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
qualities	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
affected	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
seemed	1
well	1
nigh	1
to	1
overbalance	1
all	1
the	1

uncommonly	1
conscientious	1
for	1

endued	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
natural	1
reverence	1
the	1
wild	1
watery	1
loneliness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
did	1
therefore	1
strongly	1
incline	1
him	1
to	1
superstition	1

to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
superstition	1
which	1
in	1
some	1

seems	1
rather	1

was	1
that	1
which	1
arises	1

always	1
at	1

upon	1
all	1
mortally	1

occasions	1
besides	1
he	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
whaling	1
courage	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
staple	1
outfits	1
of	1
the	1

like	1

beef	1

not	1

be	1

wherefore	1

of	1
this	1
starbuck	1
which	1
could	1

terrible	1
experiences	1

as	1
he	1

these	1
things	1
should	1
fail	1
in	1
latently	1
engendering	1
an	1

under	1

a	1
short	1

very	1
pugnacious	1
concerning	1

who	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
leviathans	1
had	1
personally	1
and	1
hereditarily	1
affronted	1
him	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
point	1
of	1
honour	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
whenever	1
encountered	1

encountering	1
them	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
poor	1
opinion	1
the	1
wondrous	1

was	1
but	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
magnified	1
mouse	1

at	1

water	1
rat	1
requiring	1
only	1
a	1
little	1

small	1
application	1
of	1

in	1

to	1
kill	1

boil	1
this	1
ignorant	1
unconscious	1

of	1

made	1
him	1
a	1
little	1

the	1

a	1
three	1

was	1
only	1
a	1
jolly	1

that	1

the	1
deck	1
from	1
my	1
watches	1
below	1
i	1
instantly	1
gazed	1
aft	1
to	1
mark	1
if	1
any	1
strange	1
face	1
were	1
visible	1
for	1
my	1
first	1
vague	1
disquietude	1
touching	1
the	1
unknown	1
captain	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
almost	1
a	1
perturbation	1
this	1
was	1
strangely	1
heightened	1
at	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
ragged	1
elijah	1
s	1
diabolical	1
incoherences	1
uninvitedly	1
recurring	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
energy	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
before	1
conceived	1
of	1
but	1
poorly	1
could	1
i	1
withstand	1
them	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
other	1
moods	1
i	1
was	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
solemn	1
whimsicalities	1
of	1
that	1
outlandish	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
wharves	1
but	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
apprehensiveness	1
or	1
uneasiness	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
so	1
which	1
i	1
felt	1
yet	1
whenever	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
it	1
seemed	1
against	1
all	1
warrantry	1
to	1
cherish	1
such	1
emotions	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
were	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
barbaric	1
heathenish	1
and	1
motley	1
set	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
tame	1
merchant	1
ship	1
companies	1
which	1
my	1
previous	1
experiences	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
acquainted	1
with	1
still	1
i	1
ascribed	1
this	1
and	1
rightly	1
ascribed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
fierce	1
uniqueness	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
that	1
wild	1
scandinavian	1
vocation	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
abandonedly	1
embarked	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
especially	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
chief	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
mates	1
which	1
was	1
most	1
forcibly	1
calculated	1
to	1
allay	1
these	1
colourless	1
misgivings	1
and	1
induce	1
confidence	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
every	1
presentment	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
three	1
better	1
more	1
likely	1
sea	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
different	1
way	1
could	1
not	1
readily	1
be	1
found	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
americans	1
a	1
nantucketer	1
a	1
vineyarder	1
a	1
cape	1
man	1
now	1
it	1
being	1
christmas	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
shot	1
from	1
out	1
her	1
harbor	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
we	1
had	1
biting	1
polar	1
weather	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
southward	1
and	1
by	1
every	1
degree	1
and	1
minute	1
of	1
latitude	1
which	1
we	1
sailed	1
gradually	1
leaving	1
that	1
merciless	1
winter	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
intolerable	1
weather	1
behind	1
us	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
less	1
lowering	1
but	1
still	1
grey	1
and	1
gloomy	1
enough	1
mornings	1
of	1
the	1
transition	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
rushing	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
a	1
vindictive	1
sort	1
of	1
leaping	1
and	1
melancholy	1
rapidity	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
mounted	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
at	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
the	1
forenoon	1
watch	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
levelled	1
my	1
glance	1
towards	1
the	1
taffrail	1
foreboding	1
shivers	1
ran	1
over	1
me	1
reality	1
outran	1
apprehension	1
captain	1
ahab	1
stood	1
upon	1
his	1
quarter	1
deck	1
	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
common	1
bodily	1
illness	1
about	1
him	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
recovery	1
from	1
any	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
cut	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
stake	1
when	1
the	1
fire	1
has	1
overrunningly	1
wasted	1
all	1
the	1
limbs	1
without	1
consuming	1
them	1
or	1
taking	1
away	1
one	1
particle	1
from	1
their	1
compacted	1
aged	1
robustness	1
his	1
whole	1
high	1
broad	1
form	1
seemed	1
made	1
of	1
solid	1
bronze	1
and	1
shaped	1
in	1
an	1
unalterable	1
mould	1
like	1
cellini	1
s	1
cast	1
perseus	1
threading	1
its	1
way	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
grey	1
hairs	1
and	1
continuing	1
right	1
down	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
tawny	1
scorched	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
till	1
it	1
disappeared	1
in	1
his	1
clothing	1
you	1
saw	1
a	1
slender	1
rod	1
like	1
mark	1
lividly	1
whitish	1
it	1
resembled	1
that	1
perpendicular	1
seam	1
sometimes	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
straight	1
lofty	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
tree	1
when	1
the	1
upper	1
lightning	1
tearingly	1
darts	1
down	1
it	1
and	1
without	1
wrenching	1
a	1
single	1
twig	1
peels	1
and	1
grooves	1
out	1
the	1
bark	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
bottom	1
ere	1
running	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
soil	1
leaving	1
the	1
tree	1
still	1
greenly	1
alive	1
but	1
branded	1
whether	1
that	1
mark	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
scar	1
left	1
by	1
some	1
desperate	1
wound	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
certainly	1
say	1
by	1
some	1
tacit	1
consent	1
throughout	1
the	1
voyage	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
allusion	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
it	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
mates	1
but	1
once	1
tashtego	1
s	1
senior	1
an	1
old	1
gay	1
head	1
indian	1
among	1
the	1
crew	1
superstitiously	1
asserted	1
that	1
not	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
did	1
ahab	1
become	1
that	1
way	1
branded	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
any	1
mortal	1
fray	1
but	1
in	1
an	1
elemental	1
strife	1
at	1
sea	1
yet	1
this	1
wild	1
hint	1
seemed	1
inferentially	1
negatived	1
by	1
what	1
a	1
grey	1
manxman	1
insinuated	1
an	1
old	1
sepulchral	1
man	1
who	1
having	1
never	1
before	1
sailed	1
out	1
of	1
nantucket	1
had	1
never	1
ere	1
this	1
laid	1
eye	1
upon	1
wild	1
ahab	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
old	1
sea	1
traditions	1
the	1
immemorial	1
credulities	1
popularly	1
invested	1
this	1
old	1
manxman	1
with	1
preternatural	1
powers	1
of	1
discernment	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
white	1
sailor	1
seriously	1
contradicted	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
ever	1
captain	1
ahab	1
should	1
be	1
tranquilly	1
laid	1
out	1
which	1
might	1
hardly	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
so	1
he	1
muttered	1
then	1
whoever	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
last	1
office	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
would	1
find	1
a	1
birth	1
mark	1
on	1
him	1
from	1
crown	1
to	1
sole	1
	1
so	1
powerfully	1
did	1
the	1
whole	1
grim	1
aspect	1
of	1
ahab	1
affect	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
livid	1
brand	1
which	1
streaked	1
it	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
moments	1
i	1
hardly	1
noted	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
overbearing	1
grimness	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
barbaric	1
white	1
leg	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
partly	1
stood	1
it	1
had	1
previously	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
ivory	1
leg	1
had	1
at	1
sea	1
been	1
fashioned	1
from	1
the	1
polished	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
jaw	1
aye	1
he	1
was	1
dismasted	1
off	1
japan	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
gay	1
head	1
indian	1
once	1
but	1
like	1
his	1
dismasted	1
craft	1
he	1
shipped	1
another	1
mast	1
without	1
coming	1
home	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
quiver	1
of	1
em	1
	1
i	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
singular	1
posture	1
he	1
maintained	1
upon	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
quarter	1
deck	1
and	1
pretty	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
mizzen	1

there	1
was	1
an	1
auger	1
hole	1
bored	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
inch	1

so	1
into	1
the	1

holding	1
by	1

captain	1

stood	1
erect	1
looking	1
straight	1
out	1
beyond	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
ever	1
pitching	1
prow	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
firmest	1
fortitude	1
a	1
determinate	1
unsurrenderable	1
wilfulness	1
in	1
the	1
fixed	1
and	1
fearless	1
forward	1
dedication	1
of	1
that	1
glance	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
spoke	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
officers	1
say	1
aught	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
by	1
all	1
their	1
minutest	1
gestures	1
and	1
expressions	1
they	1
plainly	1
showed	1
the	1
uneasy	1
if	1
not	1
painful	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
under	1
a	1
troubled	1
master	1
eye	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
but	1
moody	1
stricken	1
ahab	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
crucifixion	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
nameless	1
regal	1
overbearing	1
dignity	1
of	1
some	1
mighty	1
woe	1
	1
ere	1
long	1
from	1
his	1
first	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
withdrew	1
into	1
his	1
cabin	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
morning	1
he	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
visible	1
to	1
the	1
crew	1
either	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
pivot	1
hole	1
or	1
seated	1
upon	1
an	1
ivory	1
stool	1
he	1
had	1
or	1
heavily	1
walking	1
the	1
deck	1
as	1
the	1
sky	1
grew	1
less	1
gloomy	1
indeed	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1
little	1
genial	1
he	1
became	1
still	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
a	1
recluse	1
as	1
if	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
sailed	1
from	1
home	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
dead	1
wintry	1
bleakness	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
had	1
then	1
kept	1
him	1
so	1
secluded	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
but	1
as	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
or	1
perceptibly	1
did	1
on	1
the	1
at	1
last	1
sunny	1
deck	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
unnecessary	1
there	1
as	1
another	1
mast	1
but	1
the	1
pequod	1
was	1
only	1
making	1
a	1
passage	1
now	1
not	1
regularly	1
cruising	1
nearly	1
all	1
whaling	1
preparatives	1
needing	1
supervision	1
the	1

were	1
fully	1
competent	1
to	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
employ	1
or	1
excite	1
ahab	1
now	1
and	1
thus	1
chase	1
away	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
interval	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
layer	1
upon	1
layer	1
were	1
piled	1
upon	1
his	1
brow	1
as	1
ever	1
all	1
clouds	1
choose	1
the	1
loftiest	1
peaks	1
to	1
pile	1
themselves	1
upon	1
	1
nevertheless	1
ere	1
long	1
the	1
warm	1
warbling	1
persuasiveness	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant	1
holiday	1
weather	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
seemed	1
gradually	1
to	1
charm	1
him	1
from	1

ahab	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
a	1
little	1
respond	1
to	1
the	1
playful	1
allurings	1
of	1
that	1
girlish	1
air	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
faint	1
blossom	1
of	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
in	1
any	1

descending	1
this	1
narrow	1
scuttle	1

go	1
to	1
my	1
grave	1
dug	1
berth	1
	1
so	1
almost	1
every	1
twenty	1
four	1
hours	1
when	1
the	1
watches	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
were	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
band	1
on	1
deck	1
sentinelled	1
the	1
slumbers	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
below	1
and	1
when	1
if	1
a	1
rope	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
hauled	1
upon	1
the	1
forecastle	1
the	1
sailors	1
flung	1
it	1
not	1
rudely	1
down	1
as	1
by	1
day	1
but	1
with	1
some	1
cautiousness	1
dropt	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
disturbing	1
their	1
slumbering	1
shipmates	1
when	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
steady	1
quietude	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
prevail	1
habitually	1
the	1
silent	1
steersman	1
would	1
watch	1
the	1
cabin	1
scuttle	1
and	1
ere	1
long	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
would	1
emerge	1
gripping	1
at	1
the	1
iron	1
banister	1
to	1
help	1
his	1
crippled	1
way	1
some	1
considering	1
touch	1
of	1
humanity	1
was	1
in	1
him	1
for	1
at	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
he	1
usually	1
abstained	1
from	1
patrolling	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
because	1
to	1
his	1
wearied	1
mates	1
seeking	1
repose	1
within	1
six	1
inches	1
of	1
his	1
ivory	1
heel	1
such	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
reverberating	1
crack	1
and	1
din	1
of	1
that	1
bony	1
step	1
that	1
their	1
dreams	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
crunching	1
teeth	1
of	1
sharks	1
but	1
once	1
the	1
mood	1
was	1
on	1
him	1
too	1
deep	1
for	1
common	1
regardings	1
and	1
as	1
with	1
heavy	1
lumber	1
like	1
pace	1
he	1
was	1
measuring	1
the	1
ship	1
from	1
taffrail	1
to	1
mainmast	1
stubb	1
the	1
old	1
second	1
mate	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
below	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
unassured	1
deprecating	1
humorousness	1
hinted	1
that	1
if	1
captain	1
ahab	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
planks	1
then	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
say	1
nay	1
but	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
muffling	1
the	1
noise	1
hinting	1
something	1
indistinctly	1
and	1
hesitatingly	1
about	1
a	1
globe	1
of	1
tow	1
and	1
the	1
insertion	1
into	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
heel	1
ah	1
stubb	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
know	1
ahab	1
then	1
	1
am	1
i	1

that	1
thou	1

me	1
that	1
fashion	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
ways	1
i	1
had	1
forgot	1
below	1
to	1
thy	1
nightly	1
grave	1
where	1
such	1
as	1

at	1
the	1
unforseen	1
concluding	1
exclamation	1
of	1
the	1
so	1
suddenly	1
scornful	1
old	1
man	1
stubb	1
was	1
speechless	1
a	1
moment	1
then	1
said	1
excitedly	1
i	1

less	1

	1

gritted	1
ahab	1
between	1
his	1
set	1
teeth	1
and	1
violently	1
moving	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
avoid	1
some	1
passionate	1
temptation	1
	1
no	1

upon	1
him	1
with	1

terrors	1
in	1

you	1

the	1

man	1

ivory	1

i	1

upon	1

my	1
little	1
man	1
i	1
kicked	1
my	1

seemed	1
a	1

at	1

what	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
curious	1

you	1
know	1
how	1
curious	1
all	1
dreams	1
are	1
through	1
all	1
this	1
rage	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
i	1
somehow	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
thinking	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
of	1
an	1
insult	1
that	1
kick	1
from	1
ahab	1
why	1
thinks	1
i	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
row	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
real	1
leg	1
only	1
a	1
false	1

there	1
s	1
a	1
mighty	1
difference	1
between	1

and	1
a	1
dead	1
thump	1

what	1
makes	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1

fifty	1

that	1
makes	1
the	1

insult	1
my	1
little	1

thinks	1
i	1
to	1
myself	1
all	1

i	1
was	1
stubbing	1
my	1
silly	1
toes	1
against	1

so	1
confoundedly	1
contradictory	1
was	1
it	1
all	1
all	1
the	1

i	1

i	1
was	1
thinking	1
to	1
myself	1
what	1

now	1

a	1
cane	1
a	1
whalebone	1
cane	1
yes	1
thinks	1
i	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
playful	1
cudgelling	1
in	1
fact	1
only	1
a	1
whaleboning	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
base	1
kick	1
besides	1
thinks	1
i	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
once	1
why	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
foot	1
part	1
what	1
a	1
small	1

of	1
end	1
it	1
is	1
whereas	1
if	1
a	1

footed	1
farmer	1
kicked	1
me	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
devilish	1
broad	1
insult	1

this	1

is	1
whittled	1
down	1
to	1

the	1

owing	1

to	1

this	1

thing	1

the	1

point	1
is	1
in	1
what	1
internal	1
respect	1
does	1
the	1
whale	1
differ	1
from	1
other	1
fish	1
above	1
linnaeus	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
those	1
items	1
but	1
in	1
brief	1
they	1
are	1
these	1
lungs	1
and	1
warm	1
blood	1
whereas	1
all	1
other	1
fish	1
are	1
lungless	1
and	1
cold	1
blooded	1
	1
next	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
define	1
the	1
whale	1
by	1
his	1
obvious	1
externals	1
so	1
as	1
conspicuously	1
to	1
label	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
short	1
then	1
a	1
whale	1
is	1
a	1
spouting	1
fish	1
with	1
a	1
horizontal	1
tail	1
there	1
you	1
have	1
him	1
however	1
contracted	1
that	1
definition	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
expanded	1
meditation	1
a	1
walrus	1
spouts	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
whale	1
but	1
the	1
walrus	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
fish	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
amphibious	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
term	1
of	1
the	1
definition	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
cogent	1
as	1
coupled	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
almost	1
any	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
noticed	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
familiar	1
to	1
landsmen	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
flat	1
but	1
a	1
vertical	1
or	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
tail	1
whereas	1
among	1
spouting	1
fish	1
the	1
tail	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
similarly	1
shaped	1
invariably	1
assumes	1
a	1
horizontal	1
position	1
	1
by	1
the	1
above	1
definition	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
whale	1
is	1
i	1
do	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
exclude	1
from	1
the	1
leviathanic	1
brotherhood	1
any	1
sea	1
creature	1
hitherto	1
identified	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
informed	1
nantucketers	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
link	1
with	1
it	1
any	1
fish	1
hitherto	1
authoritatively	1
regarded	1
as	1
alien	1
hence	1
all	1
the	1
smaller	1
spouting	1
and	1
horizontal	1
tailed	1
fish	1
must	1
be	1
included	1
in	1

the	1

is	1
there	1
in	1

more	1
striking	1
than	1
his	1

yet	1
we	1

that	1
by	1
his	1

it	1
is	1
impossible	1
correctly	1
to	1

if	1
you	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1

why	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
not	1

suppose	1
from	1
his	1

being	1
originally	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
peaked	1
nose	1
the	1

some	1

its	1

some	1
exceed	1
ten	1
and	1
even	1
attain	1
to	1
fifteen	1

strictly	1

would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1

it	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1

be	1
used	1
like	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
fish	1
and	1
bill	1
fish	1
though	1
some	1
sailors	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
narwhale	1
employs	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
rake	1
in	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
bottom	1

was	1
used	1

piercer	1
for	1
the	1

rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
polar	1
sea	1
and	1
finding	1
it	1
sheeted	1
with	1
ice	1
thrusts	1
his	1
horn	1
up	1
and	1
so	1
breaks	1
through	1

you	1
cannot	1
prove	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
surmises	1
to	1
be	1
correct	1
my	1
own	1
opinion	1
is	1
that	1
however	1
this	1
one	1
sided	1
horn	1
may	1
really	1
be	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
narwhale	1
however	1
that	1
may	1

would	1
certainly	1
be	1
very	1

any	1
to	1
set	1
down	1
a	1
little	1
domestic	1
peculiarity	1

arising	1

the	1
existence	1

unknown	1
of	1

in	1

whale	1
fleet	1
	1
the	1
large	1
importance	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
s	1
vocation	1
is	1
evinced	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
originally	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
dutch	1
fishery	1
two	1
centuries	1
and	1
more	1
ago	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
now	1
called	1
the	1
captain	1
but	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
called	1
the	1
specksynder	1
literally	1
this	1
word	1
means	1
fat	1
cutter	1
usage	1
however	1
in	1
time	1
made	1
it	1
equivalent	1
to	1
chief	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
captain	1
s	1
authority	1
was	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
navigation	1
and	1
general	1
management	1
of	1
the	1

supreme	1
in	1
the	1
british	1

under	1
the	1
corrupted	1
title	1
of	1
specksioneer	1
this	1

official	1
is	1
still	1
retained	1

his	1
former	1
dignity	1
is	1
sadly	1
abridged	1
at	1

ranks	1
simply	1
as	1

upon	1

of	1
a	1

since	1
in	1

he	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
an	1
important	1
officer	1
in	1

under	1
certain	1
circumstances	1

on	1
a	1
whaling	1

the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1

deck	1
is	1
also	1
his	1
therefore	1
the	1
grand	1
political	1
maxim	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
demands	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
nominally	1
live	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
mast	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
way	1

superior	1

always	1
by	1
them	1

	1
now	1
the	1
grand	1
distinction	1
drawn	1
between	1

at	1

this	1

in	1

ships	1

alike	1

have	1
their	1

in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1

are	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
after	1
part	1
of	1
the	1

is	1
to	1

in	1

disappears	1
into	1
the	1

when	1
the	1

rouses	1
from	1

takes	1
a	1

along	1

after	1

about	1

awhile	1

then	1
slightly	1

be	1
all	1
right	1
with	1

the	1

now	1
seeing	1
himself	1
all	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1

seems	1
to	1
feel	1
relieved	1
from	1

restraint	1
for	1
tipping	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
knowing	1

squall	1
of	1

right	1
over	1

by	1

pitching	1
his	1

up	1
into	1
the	1
mizentop	1
for	1
a	1

he	1
goes	1
down	1
rollicking	1
so	1
far	1
at	1

as	1
he	1
remains	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1

reversing	1
all	1
other	1
processions	1
by	1
bringing	1
up	1
the	1
rear	1
with	1
music	1

ere	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1

pauses	1
ships	1
a	1
new	1
face	1
altogether	1

then	1
independent	1

little	1
flask	1
enters	1

s	1
presence	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
abjectus	1

the	1
slave	1
	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1

among	1
the	1

things	1
bred	1
by	1
the	1

upon	1

ten	1
to	1

those	1
very	1
officers	1
the	1
next	1

go	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
customary	1
dinner	1
in	1
that	1

cabin	1
and	1
straightway	1
their	1
inoffensive	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
deprecatory	1
and	1
humble	1
air	1
towards	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sits	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
this	1
is	1
marvellous	1
sometimes	1
most	1
comical	1
wherefore	1
this	1
difference	1
a	1
problem	1
perhaps	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
belshazzar	1
king	1
of	1
babylon	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
belshazzar	1
not	1
haughtily	1
but	1
courteously	1
therein	1
certainly	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
touch	1
of	1
mundane	1
grandeur	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
rightly	1
regal	1
and	1
intelligent	1
spirit	1
presides	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
private	1

his	1

has	1
tasted	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
caesar	1

is	1
a	1
witchery	1
of	1
social	1
czarship	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
withstanding	1
now	1
if	1
to	1
this	1
consideration	1
you	1
superadd	1
the	1
official	1
supremacy	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
master	1
then	1
by	1
inference	1
you	1
will	1
derive	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
sea	1
life	1
just	1
mentioned	1
	1
over	1
his	1
ivory	1
inlaid	1

mute	1
maned	1
sea	1
lion	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
coral	1
beach	1
surrounded	1
by	1

warlike	1

still	1
deferential	1
cubs	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
turn	1
each	1
officer	1
waited	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
little	1
children	1
before	1
ahab	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
ahab	1
there	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
lurk	1
the	1
smallest	1
social	1
arrogance	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
their	1
intent	1
eyes	1
all	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
knife	1
as	1
he	1
carved	1
the	1
chief	1
dish	1
before	1
him	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
profaned	1
that	1
moment	1
with	1
the	1
slightest	1
observation	1
even	1
upon	1
so	1
neutral	1
a	1
topic	1
as	1
the	1
weather	1
no	1

when	1

between	1
which	1
the	1

of	1

ahab	1
thereby	1
motioned	1

the	1
mate	1
received	1
his	1
meat	1
as	1
though	1
receiving	1

cut	1
it	1
tenderly	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
started	1
if	1
perchance	1
the	1
knife	1
grazed	1
against	1
the	1
plate	1
and	1
chewed	1
it	1
noiselessly	1
and	1
swallowed	1
it	1
not	1
without	1
circumspection	1
for	1
like	1
the	1
coronation	1
banquet	1
at	1
frankfort	1
where	1
the	1
german	1
emperor	1
profoundly	1
dines	1
with	1
the	1
seven	1
imperial	1
electors	1
so	1
these	1
cabin	1
meals	1
were	1
somehow	1
solemn	1
meals	1
eaten	1
in	1
awful	1
silence	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
table	1
old	1
ahab	1
forbade	1
not	1
conversation	1
only	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
dumb	1
what	1
a	1
relief	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
choking	1
stubb	1
when	1
a	1
rat	1
made	1
a	1
sudden	1
racket	1
in	1
the	1
hold	1
below	1

poor	1
little	1

he	1
was	1
the	1
youngest	1
son	1

little	1
boy	1
of	1
this	1
weary	1

party	1
his	1
were	1
the	1
shinbones	1
of	1
the	1
saline	1

would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
drumsticks	1
for	1
flask	1
to	1
have	1
presumed	1
to	1
help	1
himself	1
this	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
tantamount	1
to	1
larceny	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
degree	1
had	1
he	1
helped	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
table	1
doubtless	1
never	1
more	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
honest	1
world	1
nevertheless	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
ahab	1
never	1
forbade	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
flask	1
helped	1
himself	1
the	1
chances	1
were	1
ahab	1
had	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
noticed	1
it	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
did	1
flask	1
presume	1
to	1
help	1
himself	1
to	1
butter	1
whether	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
denied	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
clotting	1
his	1
clear	1
sunny	1
complexion	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
deemed	1
that	1
on	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
voyage	1
in	1
such	1
marketless	1
waters	1
butter	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
premium	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
subaltern	1
however	1
it	1
was	1
flask	1
alas	1
was	1
a	1
butterless	1
man	1
	1
another	1
thing	1
flask	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
person	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
dinner	1
and	1
flask	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
up	1
consider	1
for	1
hereby	1
flask	1
s	1
dinner	1
was	1
badly	1
jammed	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
time	1
starbuck	1
and	1
stubb	1
both	1
had	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
lounging	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
if	1
stubb	1
even	1
who	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
peg	1
higher	1
than	1
flask	1
happens	1
to	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
appetite	1
and	1
soon	1
shows	1
symptoms	1
of	1
concluding	1
his	1
repast	1
then	1
flask	1
must	1
bestir	1
himself	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
get	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
mouthfuls	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
holy	1
usage	1
for	1
stubb	1
to	1
precede	1
flask	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
flask	1
once	1
admitted	1
in	1
private	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
arisen	1
to	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
an	1
officer	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1

had	1
never	1
known	1

was	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
hungry	1
more	1

less	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
ate	1
did	1
not	1

much	1

hunger	1

keep	1

the	1

a	1
very	1
ancient	1
and	1
interesting	1
one	1
let	1
us	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
expatiate	1
here	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
earliest	1
standers	1
of	1
mast	1
heads	1
were	1
the	1
old	1
egyptians	1
because	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
researches	1
i	1
find	1
none	1
prior	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
though	1
their	1
progenitors	1
the	1
builders	1
of	1
babel	1
must	1
doubtless	1
by	1
their	1
tower	1
have	1
intended	1
to	1
rear	1
the	1
loftiest	1
mast	1
head	1
in	1
all	1
asia	1
or	1
africa	1
either	1
yet	1
ere	1
the	1
final	1
truck	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
that	1
great	1
stone	1
mast	1
of	1
theirs	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
by	1
the	1
board	1
in	1
the	1
dread	1
gale	1
of	1
god	1
s	1
wrath	1
therefore	1
we	1
cannot	1
give	1
these	1
babel	1
builders	1
priority	1
over	1
the	1
egyptians	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
egyptians	1
were	1
a	1
nation	1
of	1
mast	1
head	1
standers	1
is	1
an	1
assertion	1
based	1
upon	1
the	1
general	1
belief	1
among	1
archaeologists	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
pyramids	1
were	1
founded	1
for	1
astronomical	1
purposes	1
a	1
theory	1
singularly	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
peculiar	1
stair	1

formation	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
sides	1
of	1
those	1
edifices	1
whereby	1
with	1
prodigious	1
long	1
upliftings	1
of	1
their	1

those	1
old	1
astronomers	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
mount	1

the	1
apex	1

sing	1
out	1
for	1

even	1

it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
deplored	1
that	1
the	1

to	1
which	1
you	1
devote	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
term	1
of	1
your	1
natural	1
life	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
sadly	1
destitute	1
of	1
anything	1
approaching	1
to	1
a	1
cosy	1
inhabitiveness	1
or	1
adapted	1
to	1
breed	1

localness	1
of	1

in	1
which	1
men	1
temporarily	1
isolate	1
themselves	1
your	1
most	1
usual	1
point	1
of	1
perch	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1

here	1
tossed	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
beginner	1
feels	1
about	1
as	1
cosy	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
standing	1
on	1
a	1
bull	1
s	1
horns	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
in	1
cold	1
weather	1
you	1
may	1
carry	1
your	1
house	1
aloft	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
watch	1
coat	1
but	1
properly	1
speaking	1
the	1
thickest	1
watch	1
coat	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
than	1
the	1
unclad	1
body	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
soul	1
is	1
glued	1
inside	1
of	1
its	1
fleshy	1
tabernacle	1
and	1
cannot	1
freely	1
move	1
about	1
in	1
it	1
nor	1
even	1
move	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
running	1
great	1
risk	1
of	1
perishing	1
like	1
an	1
ignorant	1
pilgrim	1
crossing	1
the	1
snowy	1
alps	1
in	1
winter	1
so	1
a	1
watch	1
coat	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
envelope	1
or	1
additional	1
skin	1
encasing	1
you	1
you	1
cannot	1
put	1
a	1
shelf	1

chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
in	1
your	1
body	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
convenient	1
closet	1
of	1
your	1
watch	1
coat	1
	1
concerning	1
all	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
deplored	1
that	1
the	1

of	1

free	1
from	1
all	1

false	1
delicacy	1

being	1

the	1
sleet	1
s	1

is	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
large	1
tierce	1
or	1
pipe	1

is	1
open	1
above	1
however	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
movable	1

of	1
your	1

being	1
fixed	1
on	1

of	1

ascend	1
into	1
it	1
through	1
a	1
little	1

the	1
after	1

to	1
keep	1
your	1
speaking	1
trumpet	1
pipe	1
telescope	1
and	1
other	1
nautical	1
conveniences	1
when	1
captain	1
sleet	1
in	1
person	1
stood	1
his	1
mast	1
head	1
in	1
this	1
crow	1
s	1
nest	1
of	1
his	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
rifle	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
rack	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
powder	1
flask	1
and	1
shot	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
popping	1
off	1
the	1
stray	1
narwhales	1
or	1
vagrant	1
sea	1
unicorns	1
infesting	1
those	1
waters	1
for	1
you	1
cannot	1
successfully	1
shoot	1
at	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
deck	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
but	1
to	1
shoot	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
thing	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
plainly	1
a	1
labor	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
captain	1
sleet	1
to	1
describe	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
detailed	1
conveniences	1
of	1
his	1
crow	1
s	1
nest	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
so	1
enlarges	1
upon	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
treats	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
scientific	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
experiments	1
in	1
this	1
crow	1
s	1
nest	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
compass	1
he	1
kept	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
counteracting	1
the	1
errors	1
resulting	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
local	1
attraction	1
of	1
all	1
binnacle	1
magnets	1
an	1
error	1
ascribable	1
to	1
the	1
horizontal	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
planks	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
glacier	1
s	1
case	1
perhaps	1
to	1
there	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
broken	1
down	1
blacksmiths	1
among	1
her	1
crew	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
captain	1
is	1
very	1
discreet	1
and	1
scientific	1
here	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
learned	1
binnacle	1
deviations	1
azimuth	1
compass	1
observations	1
and	1
approximate	1
errors	1
he	1
knows	1
very	1
well	1
captain	1
sleet	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
immersed	1
in	1
those	1
profound	1
magnetic	1
meditations	1
as	1
to	1
fail	1
being	1
attracted	1
occasionally	1
towards	1
that	1
well	1
replenished	1
little	1
case	1
bottle	1
so	1
nicely	1
tucked	1
in	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
crow	1
s	1
nest	1
within	1
easy	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
though	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
i	1
greatly	1
admire	1
and	1
even	1
love	1
the	1
brave	1
the	1
honest	1
and	1
learned	1
captain	1
yet	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
so	1
utterly	1
ignore	1
that	1
case	1
bottle	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
faithful	1
friend	1
and	1
comforter	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
while	1
with	1
mittened	1
fingers	1
and	1
hooded	1
head	1
he	1
was	1
studying	1
the	1
mathematics	1
aloft	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
bird	1
s	1
nest	1
within	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
perches	1
of	1
the	1
pole	1
	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
southern	1
whale	1
fishers	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
snugly	1
housed	1
aloft	1
as	1
captain	1
sleet	1
and	1
his	1
greenlandmen	1
were	1
yet	1
that	1
disadvantage	1
is	1
greatly	1
counter	1
balanced	1
by	1
the	1
widely	1
contrasting	1
serenity	1
of	1
those	1
seductive	1
seas	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
south	1
fishers	1
mostly	1
float	1
for	1
one	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
lounge	1
up	1
the	1
rigging	1
very	1
leisurely	1
resting	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
chat	1
with	1
queequeg	1
or	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
off	1
duty	1
whom	1
i	1
might	1
find	1
there	1
then	1
ascending	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
further	1
and	1
throwing	1
a	1
lazy	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
sail	1
yard	1
take	1
a	1
preliminary	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
watery	1
pastures	1
and	1
so	1
at	1
last	1
mount	1
to	1
my	1
ultimate	1
destination	1
	1
let	1
me	1
make	1
a	1
clean	1
breast	1
of	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
frankly	1
admit	1
that	1
i	1
kept	1
but	1
sorry	1
guard	1
with	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
revolving	1
in	1
me	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
being	1
left	1
completely	1
to	1
myself	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
thought	1
engendering	1
altitude	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
but	1
lightly	1
hold	1
my	1
obligations	1
to	1
observe	1
all	1
whale	1
ships	1
standing	1
orders	1
keep	1
your	1
weather	1
eye	1
open	1
and	1
sing	1
out	1
every	1
time	1
	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
movingly	1
admonish	1
you	1
ye	1
ship	1
owners	1
of	1
nantucket	1
beware	1
of	1
enlisting	1
in	1
your	1
vigilant	1
fisheries	1
any	1
lad	1
with	1
lean	1
brow	1
and	1
hollow	1
eye	1
given	1
to	1
unseasonable	1
meditativeness	1
and	1
who	1
offers	1
to	1

with	1

was	1
heard	1
as	1
to	1

fro	1
he	1
paced	1
his	1
old	1

upon	1
planks	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
his	1
tread	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
over	1
dented	1
like	1
geological	1
stones	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1

did	1
you	1
fixedly	1
gaze	1
too	1
upon	1

looked	1
deeper	1

as	1
his	1

that	1

left	1
a	1
deeper	1

full	1
of	1

assembled	1

with	1
curious	1
and	1
not	1
wholly	1
unapprehensive	1
faces	1
were	1
eyeing	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
not	1

the	1

when	1
a	1
storm	1
is	1
coming	1
up	1

from	1

heavy	1
turns	1
upon	1
the	1

with	1
bent	1

among	1

cautiously	1
whispered	1
to	1

have	1
summoned	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1

witnessing	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
feat	1

this	1
did	1
not	1

vehemently	1

from	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
clubbed	1
voices	1
	1
good	1
cried	1
ahab	1
with	1
a	1
wild	1
approval	1
in	1
his	1
tones	1
observing	1
the	1
hearty	1
animation	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
unexpected	1
question	1
had	1
so	1
magnetically	1
thrown	1
them	1
	1

what	1
do	1
ye	1
next	1

	1

	1
more	1

more	1
strangely	1
and	1
fiercely	1
glad	1
and	1
approving	1
grew	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
every	1
shout	1
while	1
the	1
mariners	1
began	1
to	1
gaze	1
curiously	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
if	1
marvelling	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
themselves	1
became	1
so	1
excited	1
at	1
such	1
seemingly	1
purposeless	1
questions	1
	1

they	1
were	1
all	1
eagerness	1
again	1
as	1

half	1
revolving	1
in	1
his	1

without	1

was	1
slowly	1
rubbing	1
the	1
gold	1

against	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
his	1

to	1

without	1

lowly	1
humming	1
to	1
himself	1
producing	1
a	1
sound	1

inarticulate	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
mechanical	1
humming	1
of	1

of	1
his	1
vitality	1
in	1
him	1
	1
receiving	1
the	1
top	1

from	1

advanced	1
towards	1
the	1

uplifted	1
in	1

exhibiting	1

unaccountable	1
to	1

from	1

the	1

as	1

thing	1
placed	1
upon	1

years	1

that	1

be	1

in	1
some	1
of	1

by	1

it	1

be	1
a	1
lake	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
wrecks	1
of	1
ships	1
floated	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
that	1
still	1
more	1
wonderful	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
arethusa	1
fountain	1
near	1
syracuse	1
whose	1
waters	1
were	1
believed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
land	1
by	1
an	1
underground	1
passage	1
these	1
fabulous	1
narrations	1
are	1
almost	1
fully	1
equalled	1
by	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
the	1
whalemen	1
	1
forced	1
into	1
familiarity	1
then	1
with	1
such	1
prodigies	1
as	1
these	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
after	1
repeated	1
intrepid	1
assaults	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
had	1
escaped	1
alive	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
much	1
matter	1
of	1
surprise	1
that	1
some	1
whalemen	1
should	1
go	1
still	1
further	1
in	1
their	1
superstitions	1
declaring	1
moby	1
dick	1
not	1
only	1
ubiquitous	1
but	1
immortal	1
for	1
immortality	1
is	1
but	1
ubiquity	1
in	1
time	1
that	1
though	1
groves	1
of	1
spears	1
should	1
be	1
planted	1
in	1
his	1
flanks	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
swim	1
away	1
unharmed	1
or	1
if	1
indeed	1
he	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
spout	1
thick	1
blood	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
ghastly	1
deception	1
for	1
again	1
in	1
unensanguined	1
billows	1
hundreds	1
of	1
leagues	1
away	1
his	1
unsullied	1
jet	1
would	1
once	1
more	1
be	1
seen	1
	1
but	1
even	1
stripped	1
of	1
these	1
supernatural	1
surmisings	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
earthly	1
make	1
and	1
incontestable	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
to	1
strike	1
the	1
imagination	1
with	1
unwonted	1
power	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
his	1
uncommon	1
bulk	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
other	1
sperm	1
whales	1
but	1
as	1
was	1
elsewhere	1
thrown	1
out	1
a	1
peculiar	1
snow	1
white	1
wrinkled	1
forehead	1
and	1
a	1
high	1
pyramidical	1
white	1
hump	1
these	1
were	1
his	1
prominent	1
features	1
the	1
tokens	1
whereby	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
limitless	1
uncharted	1
seas	1
he	1
revealed	1
his	1
identity	1
at	1
a	1
long	1
distance	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
so	1
streaked	1
and	1
spotted	1
and	1
marbled	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
shrouded	1
hue	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
his	1
distinctive	1
appellation	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
a	1
name	1
indeed	1
literally	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
vivid	1
aspect	1
when	1
seen	1
gliding	1
at	1
high	1
noon	1
through	1
a	1
dark	1
blue	1
sea	1
leaving	1
a	1
milky	1
way	1
wake	1
of	1
creamy	1
foam	1
all	1
spangled	1
with	1
golden	1
gleamings	1
	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
his	1
unwonted	1
magnitude	1
nor	1
his	1
remarkable	1
hue	1
nor	1
yet	1
his	1
deformed	1
lower	1
jaw	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
invested	1
the	1
whale	1
with	1
natural	1
terror	1
as	1
that	1
unexampled	1
intelligent	1
malignity	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
specific	1
accounts	1
he	1
had	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
evinced	1
in	1
his	1
assaults	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
treacherous	1
retreats	1
struck	1
more	1
of	1
dismay	1
than	1
perhaps	1
aught	1
else	1
for	1
when	1
swimming	1
before	1
his	1
exulting	1
pursuers	1
with	1
every	1
apparent	1
symptom	1
of	1
alarm	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
suddenly	1
and	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
either	1
stave	1
their	1
boats	1
to	1
splinters	1
or	1
drive	1
them	1
back	1
in	1
consternation	1
to	1
their	1
ship	1
	1
already	1
several	1
fatalities	1
had	1
attended	1
his	1
chase	1
but	1
though	1
similar	1
disasters	1
however	1
little	1
bruited	1
ashore	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unusual	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
yet	1
in	1
most	1
instances	1
such	1
seemed	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
infernal	1
aforethought	1
of	1
ferocity	1
that	1
every	1
dismembering	1
or	1
death	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
regarded	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
inflicted	1
by	1
an	1
unintelligent	1
agent	1
	1
judge	1
then	1
to	1
what	1
pitches	1
of	1
inflamed	1
distracted	1
fury	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
his	1
more	1
desperate	1
hunters	1
were	1
impelled	1
when	1
amid	1
the	1
chips	1
of	1
chewed	1
boats	1
and	1
the	1
sinking	1
limbs	1
of	1
torn	1
comrades	1
they	1
swam	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
curds	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
direful	1
wrath	1
into	1
the	1
serene	1
exasperating	1
sunlight	1
that	1
smiled	1
on	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
birth	1
or	1
a	1
bridal	1
	1
his	1
three	1
boats	1
stove	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
oars	1
and	1
men	1
both	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
eddies	1
one	1
captain	1
seizing	1
the	1
line	1
knife	1
from	1
his	1
broken	1
prow	1
had	1
dashed	1
at	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
an	1
arkansas	1
duellist	1
at	1
his	1
foe	1
blindly	1
seeking	1
with	1
a	1
six	1
inch	1
blade	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
fathom	1
deep	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
that	1
captain	1
was	1
ahab	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
suddenly	1
sweeping	1
his	1
sickle	1
shaped	1
lower	1
jaw	1
beneath	1
him	1
moby	1
dick	1
had	1
reaped	1
away	1
ahab	1
s	1
leg	1
as	1
a	1
mower	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
no	1
turbaned	1
turk	1
no	1
hired	1
venetian	1
or	1
malay	1
could	1
have	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
seeming	1
malice	1
small	1
reason	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
doubt	1
then	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
that	1
almost	1
fatal	1
encounter	1
ahab	1
had	1
cherished	1
a	1
wild	1
vindictiveness	1
against	1
the	1
whale	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
fell	1
for	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
frantic	1
morbidness	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
came	1
to	1
identify	1
with	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
his	1
bodily	1
woes	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
intellectual	1
and	1
spiritual	1
exasperations	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
swam	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
monomaniac	1
incarnation	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
malicious	1
agencies	1
which	1
some	1
deep	1
men	1
feel	1
eating	1
in	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
are	1
left	1
living	1
on	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
lung	1
that	1
intangible	1
malignity	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
whose	1
dominion	1
even	1
the	1
modern	1
christians	1
ascribe	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
worlds	1
which	1
the	1
ancient	1
ophites	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
reverenced	1
in	1
their	1
statue	1
devil	1
ahab	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
it	1
like	1
them	1
but	1
deliriously	1
transferring	1
its	1
idea	1
to	1
the	1
abhorred	1
white	1
whale	1
he	1
pitted	1
himself	1
all	1
mutilated	1
against	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
most	1
maddens	1
and	1
torments	1
all	1
that	1
stirs	1
up	1
the	1
lees	1
of	1
things	1
all	1
truth	1
with	1
malice	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
cracks	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
cakes	1
the	1
brain	1
all	1
the	1
subtle	1
demonisms	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
thought	1
all	1
evil	1
to	1
crazy	1
ahab	1
were	1
visibly	1
personified	1
and	1
made	1
practically	1
assailable	1
in	1
moby	1
dick	1
he	1
piled	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
white	1
hump	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
general	1
rage	1
and	1
hate	1
felt	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
race	1
from	1
adam	1
down	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
chest	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
mortar	1
he	1
burst	1
his	1
hot	1
heart	1
s	1
shell	1
upon	1
it	1
	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
probable	1
that	1
this	1
monomania	1
in	1
him	1
took	1
its	1
instant	1
rise	1
at	1
the	1
precise	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
bodily	1
dismemberment	1
then	1
in	1
darting	1
at	1
the	1
monster	1
knife	1
in	1
hand	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
given	1
loose	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
passionate	1
corporal	1
animosity	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
stroke	1
that	1
tore	1
him	1
he	1
probably	1
but	1
felt	1
the	1
agonizing	1
bodily	1
laceration	1
but	1
nothing	1
more	1
yet	1
when	1
by	1
this	1
collision	1
forced	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
home	1
and	1
for	1
long	1
months	1
of	1
days	1
and	1
weeks	1
ahab	1
and	1
anguish	1
lay	1
stretched	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
hammock	1
rounding	1
in	1
mid	1
winter	1
that	1
dreary	1
howling	1
patagonian	1
cape	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
torn	1
body	1
and	1
gashed	1
soul	1
bled	1
into	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
so	1
interfusing	1
made	1
him	1
mad	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
homeward	1
voyage	1
after	1
the	1
encounter	1
that	1
the	1
final	1
monomania	1
seized	1
him	1
seems	1
all	1
but	1
certain	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
at	1
intervals	1
during	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
raving	1
lunatic	1
and	1
though	1
unlimbed	1
of	1
a	1
leg	1
yet	1
such	1
vital	1
strength	1
yet	1
lurked	1
in	1
his	1
egyptian	1
chest	1
and	1
was	1
moreover	1
intensified	1
by	1
his	1
delirium	1
that	1
his	1
mates	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
lace	1
him	1
fast	1
even	1
there	1
as	1
he	1
sailed	1
raving	1
in	1
his	1
hammock	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
jacket	1
he	1
swung	1
to	1
the	1
mad	1
rockings	1
of	1
the	1
gales	1
and	1
when	1
running	1
into	1
more	1
sufferable	1
latitudes	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
mild	1
stun	1
sails	1
spread	1
floated	1
across	1
the	1
tranquil	1
tropics	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearances	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
delirium	1
seemed	1
left	1
behind	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cape	1
horn	1
swells	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
dark	1
den	1
into	1
the	1
blessed	1
light	1
and	1
air	1
even	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
bore	1
that	1
firm	1
collected	1
front	1
however	1
pale	1
and	1
issued	1
his	1
calm	1
orders	1
once	1
again	1
and	1
his	1
mates	1
thanked	1
god	1
the	1
direful	1
madness	1
was	1
now	1
gone	1
even	1
then	1
ahab	1
in	1
his	1
hidden	1
self	1
raved	1
on	1
human	1
madness	1
is	1
oftentimes	1
a	1
cunning	1
and	1
most	1
feline	1
thing	1
when	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
fled	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
but	1
become	1
transfigured	1
into	1
some	1
still	1
subtler	1
form	1
ahab	1
s	1
full	1
lunacy	1
subsided	1
not	1
but	1
deepeningly	1
contracted	1
like	1
the	1
unabated	1
hudson	1
when	1
that	1
noble	1
northman	1
flows	1
narrowly	1
but	1
unfathomably	1
through	1
the	1
highland	1
gorge	1
but	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
narrow	1
flowing	1
monomania	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
of	1
ahab	1
s	1
broad	1
madness	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
behind	1
so	1
in	1
that	1
broad	1
madness	1
not	1
one	1
jot	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
natural	1
intellect	1
had	1
perished	1
that	1
before	1
living	1
agent	1
now	1
became	1
the	1
living	1
instrument	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
furious	1
trope	1
may	1
stand	1
his	1
special	1
lunacy	1
stormed	1
his	1
general	1
sanity	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
all	1
its	1
concentred	1
cannon	1
upon	1
its	1
own	1
mad	1
mark	1
so	1
that	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
strength	1
ahab	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
end	1
did	1
now	1
possess	1
a	1
thousand	1
fold	1
more	1
potency	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
had	1
sanely	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
any	1
one	1
reasonable	1
object	1
	1
this	1
is	1
much	1

ahab	1

larger	1
darker	1
deeper	1
part	1
remains	1
unhinted	1
but	1
vain	1
to	1
popularize	1
profundities	1
and	1
all	1
truth	1
is	1
profound	1
winding	1
far	1
down	1
from	1
within	1
the	1

come	1
	1
now	1
in	1
his	1

ahab	1
had	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
this	1
namely	1
all	1
my	1
means	1
are	1
sane	1
my	1
motive	1
and	1
my	1
object	1
mad	1
yet	1
without	1
power	1
to	1
kill	1
or	1
change	1
or	1
shun	1
the	1
fact	1
he	1
likewise	1
knew	1
that	1
to	1
mankind	1
he	1
did	1
long	1
dissemble	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
did	1
still	1
but	1
that	1
thing	1
of	1
his	1
dissembling	1
was	1
only	1
subject	1
to	1
his	1
perceptibility	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
determinate	1
nevertheless	1
so	1
well	1
did	1
he	1
succeed	1
in	1
that	1
dissembling	1
that	1
when	1
with	1
ivory	1
leg	1
he	1
stepped	1
ashore	1
at	1
last	1
no	1
nantucketer	1
thought	1
him	1
otherwise	1
than	1
but	1
naturally	1
grieved	1

urged	1
by	1
him	1
who	1

still	1
deeper	1
into	1
this	1
matter	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1

heightens	1
the	1

brute	1

that	1
heightened	1
hideousness	1

might	1
be	1
said	1
only	1
rises	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1

the	1

ferociousness	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1

invested	1
in	1
the	1
fleece	1
of	1
celestial	1
innocence	1

love	1

hence	1

bringing	1
together	1
two	1
such	1
opposite	1
emotions	1
in	1
our	1
minds	1
the	1
polar	1
bear	1
frightens	1
us	1

so	1
unnatural	1
a	1
contrast	1

even	1

all	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
true	1

were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1

not	1

that	1
intensified	1
terror	1

it	1
though	1
bodily	1
unharmed	1
it	1
uttered	1
cries	1
as	1
some	1
king	1
s	1
ghost	1
in	1
supernatural	1
distress	1
through	1
its	1
inexpressible	1
strange	1
eyes	1
methought	1
i	1
peeped	1
to	1
secrets	1
which	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
god	1
as	1
abraham	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
i	1
bowed	1
myself	1
the	1
white	1
thing	1
was	1
so	1
white	1
its	1
wings	1
so	1
wide	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
for	1
ever	1
exiled	1
waters	1
i	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
miserable	1
warping	1
memories	1
of	1
traditions	1
and	1
of	1
towns	1
long	1
i	1
gazed	1
at	1
that	1
prodigy	1
of	1
plumage	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
can	1
only	1
hint	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
darted	1
through	1
me	1
then	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
awoke	1
and	1
turning	1
asked	1
a	1
sailor	1
what	1
bird	1
was	1
this	1
a	1
goney	1
he	1
replied	1
goney	1
never	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
name	1
before	1
is	1
it	1
conceivable	1
that	1
this	1
glorious	1
thing	1
is	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
men	1
ashore	1
never	1
but	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
i	1
learned	1
that	1
goney	1
was	1
some	1
seaman	1
s	1
name	1
for	1
albatross	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
no	1
possibility	1
could	1
coleridge	1
s	1
wild	1
rhyme	1
have	1
had	1
aught	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
those	1
mystical	1
impressions	1
which	1
were	1
mine	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
bird	1
upon	1
our	1
deck	1
for	1
neither	1
had	1
i	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
rhyme	1
nor	1
knew	1
the	1
bird	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
albatross	1
yet	1
in	1
saying	1
this	1
i	1
do	1
but	1
indirectly	1
burnish	1
a	1
little	1
brighter	1
the	1
noble	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
and	1
the	1
poet	1
	1
i	1
assert	1
then	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wondrous	1
bodily	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
chiefly	1
lurks	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
spell	1
a	1
truth	1
the	1
more	1
evinced	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
by	1
a	1
solecism	1
of	1
terms	1
there	1
are	1
birds	1
called	1
grey	1
albatrosses	1
and	1
these	1
i	1
have	1
frequently	1
seen	1
but	1
never	1
with	1
such	1
emotions	1
as	1
when	1
i	1
beheld	1
the	1
antarctic	1
fowl	1
	1
but	1
how	1
had	1
the	1
mystic	1
thing	1
been	1
caught	1
whisper	1
it	1
not	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
with	1
a	1
treacherous	1
hook	1
and	1
line	1
as	1
the	1
fowl	1
floated	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
captain	1
made	1
a	1
postman	1
of	1
it	1
tying	1
a	1
lettered	1
leathern	1
tally	1
round	1
its	1
neck	1
with	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
time	1
and	1
place	1
and	1
then	1
letting	1
it	1
escape	1
but	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
leathern	1
tally	1
meant	1
for	1
man	1
was	1
taken	1
off	1
in	1
heaven	1
when	1
the	1
white	1
fowl	1
flew	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
wing	1
folding	1
the	1
invoking	1
and	1
adoring	1
cherubim	1
	1
	1
most	1
famous	1
in	1
our	1
western	1
annals	1
and	1
indian	1
traditions	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
steed	1
of	1
the	1
prairies	1
a	1
magnificent	1
milk	1
white	1
charger	1
large	1
eyed	1
small	1
headed	1
bluff	1
chested	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
monarchs	1
in	1
his	1
lofty	1
overscorning	1
carriage	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
elected	1
xerxes	1
of	1
vast	1
herds	1
of	1
wild	1
horses	1
whose	1
pastures	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
only	1
fenced	1
by	1
the	1
rocky	1
mountains	1
and	1
the	1
alleghanies	1
at	1
their	1
flaming	1
head	1
he	1
westward	1
trooped	1
it	1
like	1
that	1
chosen	1
star	1
which	1
every	1
evening	1
leads	1
on	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
light	1
the	1
flashing	1
cascade	1
of	1
his	1
mane	1
the	1
curving	1
comet	1
of	1
his	1
tail	1
invested	1
him	1
with	1
housings	1
more	1
resplendent	1
than	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
beaters	1
could	1
have	1
furnished	1
him	1
a	1
most	1
imperial	1
and	1
archangelical	1
apparition	1
of	1
that	1
unfallen	1
western	1
world	1
which	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
trappers	1
and	1
hunters	1
revived	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
those	1
primeval	1
times	1
when	1
adam	1
walked	1
majestic	1
as	1
a	1
god	1
bluff	1
browed	1
and	1
fearless	1
as	1
this	1
mighty	1
steed	1
whether	1
marching	1
amid	1
his	1
aides	1
and	1
marshals	1
in	1
the	1
van	1
of	1
countless	1
cohorts	1
that	1
endlessly	1
streamed	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
plains	1
like	1
an	1
ohio	1
or	1
whether	1
with	1
his	1
circumambient	1
subjects	1
browsing	1
all	1
around	1
at	1
the	1
horizon	1
the	1
white	1
steed	1
gallopingly	1
reviewed	1
them	1
with	1
warm	1
nostrils	1
reddening	1
through	1
his	1
cool	1
milkiness	1
in	1
whatever	1
aspect	1
he	1
presented	1
himself	1
always	1
to	1
the	1
bravest	1
indians	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
trembling	1
reverence	1
and	1
awe	1
nor	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
questioned	1
from	1
what	1
stands	1
on	1
legendary	1
record	1
of	1
this	1
noble	1
horse	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
spiritual	1
whiteness	1
chiefly	1
which	1
so	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
divineness	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
divineness	1
had	1
that	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
though	1
commanding	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
enforced	1
a	1
certain	1
nameless	1
terror	1
	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
instances	1
where	1
this	1
whiteness	1
loses	1
all	1
that	1
accessory	1
and	1
strange	1
glory	1
which	1
invests	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
steed	1
and	1
albatross	1
	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
albino	1
man	1
so	1
peculiarly	1
repels	1
and	1
often	1
shocks	1
the	1
eye	1
as	1
that	1
sometimes	1
he	1
is	1
loathed	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
kith	1
and	1
kin	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
whiteness	1
which	1
invests	1
him	1
a	1
thing	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
he	1
bears	1
the	1
albino	1
is	1
as	1
well	1
made	1
as	1
other	1

no	1
substantive	1
deformity	1
and	1
yet	1
this	1
mere	1
aspect	1
of	1
all	1
pervading	1
whiteness	1
makes	1
him	1
more	1
strangely	1
hideous	1
than	1
the	1
ugliest	1
abortion	1
why	1
should	1
this	1
be	1
so	1
	1
nor	1
in	1
quite	1

nature	1
in	1

fail	1
to	1

among	1
her	1

this	1
crowning	1
attribute	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
from	1
its	1

aspect	1
the	1

ghost	1

quality	1

of	1
the	1

most	1
appals	1

the	1
marble	1

lingering	1
there	1
as	1
if	1
indeed	1
that	1
pallor	1
were	1
as	1

the	1
badge	1
of	1
consternation	1
in	1
the	1

of	1

from	1

the	1

such	1

what	1

the	1

	1

the	1

when	1
drawing	1

if	1

enough	1
of	1

to	1
sharpen	1
all	1

his	1

sailing	1
through	1
a	1
midnight	1

from	1
encircling	1

phantom	1
of	1
the	1

fancying	1
of	1
the	1
eternal	1

reigning	1
at	1

the	1

which	1
this	1

they	1
may	1
be	1
trampling	1
into	1

the	1

	1

with	1
me	1

with	1
the	1

somewhere	1
those	1

exist	1

	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
have	1
we	1
solved	1
the	1
incantation	1
of	1
this	1
whiteness	1
and	1
learned	1
why	1
it	1
appeals	1
with	1
such	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
more	1
strange	1
and	1
far	1
more	1
portentous	1
why	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
most	1
meaning	1
symbol	1
of	1
spiritual	1
things	1
nay	1
the	1
very	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
christian	1
s	1
deity	1
and	1
yet	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
intensifying	1
agent	1
in	1
things	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
to	1
mankind	1
	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
by	1
its	1
indefiniteness	1
it	1
shadows	1
forth	1
the	1
heartless	1
voids	1
and	1
immensities	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
and	1
thus	1
stabs	1
us	1
from	1
behind	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
annihilation	1
when	1
beholding	1
the	1
white	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
milky	1
way	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
as	1
in	1
essence	1
whiteness	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
colour	1
as	1
the	1
visible	1
absence	1
of	1

and	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
the	1
concrete	1
of	1
all	1

is	1
it	1
for	1
these	1
reasons	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
dumb	1
blankness	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1
landscape	1
of	1
snows	1
a	1
colourless	1
all	1
colour	1
of	1
atheism	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
shrink	1
and	1
when	1
we	1

the	1

subtile	1
deceits	1
not	1
actually	1
inherent	1
in	1

only	1
laid	1
on	1
from	1
without	1

pondered	1
over	1
his	1
charts	1
almost	1
every	1
night	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
out	1
almost	1
every	1
night	1
some	1
pencil	1
marks	1
were	1
effaced	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
substituted	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
charts	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
oceans	1
before	1
him	1
ahab	1
was	1
threading	1
a	1
maze	1
of	1
currents	1
and	1
eddies	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
certain	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
that	1
monomaniac	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
	1
now	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
not	1
fully	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
leviathans	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
an	1
absurdly	1
hopeless	1
task	1
thus	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
one	1
solitary	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
unhooped	1
oceans	1
of	1
this	1
planet	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
ahab	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
sets	1
of	1
all	1
tides	1
and	1
currents	1
and	1
thereby	1
calculating	1
the	1
driftings	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
food	1
and	1
also	1
calling	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
regular	1
ascertained	1
seasons	1
for	1
hunting	1
him	1
in	1
particular	1
latitudes	1
could	1
arrive	1
at	1
reasonable	1
surmises	1
almost	1
approaching	1
to	1
certainties	1
concerning	1
the	1
timeliest	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
ground	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
his	1
prey	1
	1
so	1
assured	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
concerning	1
the	1
periodicalness	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
resorting	1
to	1
given	1
waters	1
that	1
many	1
hunters	1
believe	1
that	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
closely	1
observed	1
and	1
studied	1
throughout	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
the	1
logs	1
for	1
one	1
voyage	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
whale	1
fleet	1
carefully	1
collated	1
then	1
the	1
migrations	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
correspond	1
in	1
invariability	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
herring	1
shoals	1
or	1
the	1
flights	1
of	1
swallows	1
on	1
this	1
hint	1
attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
construct	1
elaborate	1
migratory	1
charts	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
	1
since	1
the	1
above	1
was	1
written	1
the	1
statement	1
is	1
happily	1
borne	1
out	1
by	1
an	1
official	1

by	1

that	1

circumspectly	1

at	1

upon	1
well	1
known	1

could	1
ahab	1
hope	1

in	1
crossing	1
the	1
widest	1
expanses	1
of	1

he	1
could	1
by	1
his	1

so	1
place	1
and	1
time	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1

as	1
even	1
then	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wholly	1
without	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
meeting	1
	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
seemed	1
to	1
entangle	1
his	1
delirious	1
but	1
still	1
methodical	1
scheme	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
reality	1
perhaps	1
though	1
the	1
gregarious	1
sperm	1
whales	1
have	1
their	1
regular	1
seasons	1
for	1
particular	1
grounds	1
yet	1
in	1
general	1
you	1
cannot	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
herds	1
which	1
haunted	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
latitude	1
or	1
longitude	1
this	1
year	1
say	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
identically	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
there	1
the	1
preceding	1
season	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
peculiar	1
and	1
unquestionable	1
instances	1
where	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
has	1
proved	1
true	1
in	1
general	1
the	1

remark	1
only	1
within	1
a	1
less	1
wide	1
limit	1
applies	1
to	1
the	1
solitaries	1
and	1
hermits	1
among	1
the	1
matured	1
aged	1
sperm	1
whales	1
so	1
that	1
though	1
moby	1
dick	1
had	1
in	1
a	1

for	1

of	1
those	1

at	1

infallibly	1

him	1
there	1
so	1
too	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
feeding	1
grounds	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
times	1
revealed	1
himself	1

all	1
these	1
seemed	1
only	1
his	1
casual	1

ocean	1

so	1
to	1
speak	1
not	1
his	1

were	1
attained	1
when	1
all	1
possibilities	1
would	1

ahab	1
fondly	1
thought	1
every	1

the	1
next	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
particular	1

were	1
conjoined	1
in	1
the	1

the	1

the	1

for	1
there	1

then	1
for	1
several	1

years	1
moby	1
dick	1
had	1
been	1
periodically	1
descried	1
lingering	1
in	1
those	1
waters	1
for	1
awhile	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
its	1
annual	1
round	1
loiters	1
for	1
a	1
predicted	1
interval	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
zodiac	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
deadly	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
there	1
the	1
waves	1
were	1
storied	1
with	1
his	1
deeds	1
there	1
also	1
was	1
that	1
tragic	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
monomaniac	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
awful	1
motive	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
cautious	1
comprehensiveness	1
and	1
unloitering	1
vigilance	1
with	1
which	1
ahab	1
threw	1
his	1
brooding	1
soul	1
into	1
this	1
unfaltering	1
hunt	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
himself	1
to	1
rest	1
all	1
his	1
hopes	1
upon	1
the	1
one	1
crowning	1
fact	1
above	1
mentioned	1
however	1
flattering	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
those	1
hopes	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
sleeplessness	1
of	1
his	1
vow	1
could	1
he	1
so	1
tranquillize	1
his	1
unquiet	1
heart	1
as	1
to	1
postpone	1
all	1
intervening	1
quest	1
	1
now	1
the	1
pequod	1
had	1
sailed	1
from	1
nantucket	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
season	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
no	1
possible	1
endeavor	1
then	1
could	1
enable	1
her	1
commander	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
great	1
passage	1
southwards	1
double	1
cape	1
horn	1
and	1
then	1
running	1
down	1
sixty	1
degrees	1
of	1
latitude	1
arrive	1
in	1
the	1
equatorial	1
pacific	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
cruise	1
there	1
therefore	1
he	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
ensuing	1
season	1
yet	1
the	1
premature	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
sailing	1
had	1
perhaps	1
been	1
correctly	1
selected	1
by	1
ahab	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
this	1
very	1
complexion	1
of	1
things	1
because	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
five	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
an	1
interval	1
which	1
instead	1
of	1
impatiently	1
enduring	1
ashore	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
in	1
a	1
miscellaneous	1
hunt	1
if	1
by	1
chance	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
spending	1
his	1
vacation	1
in	1
seas	1
far	1
remote	1
from	1
his	1
periodical	1
feeding	1
grounds	1
should	1
turn	1
up	1
his	1
wrinkled	1
brow	1
off	1
the	1
persian	1
gulf	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
bengal	1
bay	1
or	1
china	1
seas	1
or	1
in	1
any	1

waters	1
haunted	1
by	1
his	1
race	1
so	1
that	1

all	1
this	1

it	1
not	1

a	1
mad	1
idea	1
this	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
boundless	1
ocean	1
one	1
solitary	1
whale	1
even	1
if	1
encountered	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
capable	1
of	1
individual	1
recognition	1
from	1
his	1
hunter	1
even	1
as	1

be	1
unmistakable	1
and	1
have	1
i	1
not	1
tallied	1
the	1
whale	1
ahab	1
would	1
mutter	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
after	1
poring	1
over	1
his	1
charts	1
till	1
long	1
after	1
midnight	1
he	1
would	1
throw	1
himself	1
back	1
in	1
reveries	1
tallied	1
him	1
and	1
shall	1
he	1
escape	1
his	1
broad	1
fins	1
are	1
bored	1
and	1
scalloped	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
sheep	1
s	1

and	1
here	1
his	1
mad	1
mind	1
would	1
run	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
race	1
till	1
a	1
weariness	1
and	1
faintness	1
of	1
pondering	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
would	1
seek	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
strength	1
ah	1
god	1
what	1
trances	1
of	1
torments	1
does	1
that	1
man	1
endure	1
who	1
is	1
consumed	1
with	1
one	1
unachieved	1
revengeful	1
desire	1
he	1
sleeps	1
with	1
clenched	1
hands	1
and	1
wakes	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
bloody	1
nails	1
in	1
his	1
palms	1
	1
often	1
when	1
forced	1
from	1
his	1
hammock	1
by	1
exhausting	1
and	1
intolerably	1
vivid	1
dreams	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
which	1
resuming	1
his	1
own	1
intense	1
thoughts	1
through	1
the	1
day	1
carried	1
them	1
on	1
amid	1
a	1
clashing	1
of	1
phrensies	1
and	1
whirled	1
them	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
in	1
his	1
blazing	1
brain	1
till	1
the	1
very	1
throbbing	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
spot	1
became	1
insufferable	1
anguish	1
and	1
when	1
as	1
was	1
sometimes	1
the	1
case	1
these	1
spiritual	1
throes	1
in	1
him	1
heaved	1
his	1
being	1
up	1
from	1
its	1
base	1
and	1
a	1
chasm	1
seemed	1
opening	1
in	1
him	1
from	1
which	1
forked	1
flames	1
and	1
lightnings	1
shot	1
up	1
and	1
accursed	1
fiends	1
beckoned	1
him	1
to	1
leap	1
down	1
among	1
them	1
when	1
this	1
hell	1
in	1
himself	1
yawned	1
beneath	1
him	1
a	1
wild	1
cry	1
would	1
be	1
heard	1
through	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
with	1
glaring	1
eyes	1
ahab	1
would	1
burst	1
from	1
his	1
state	1
room	1
as	1
though	1
escaping	1
from	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
fire	1
yet	1
these	1
perhaps	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
unsuppressable	1
symptoms	1
of	1
some	1
latent	1
weakness	1
or	1
fright	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
resolve	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
plainest	1
tokens	1
of	1
its	1
intensity	1
for	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
crazy	1
ahab	1
the	1
scheming	1
unappeasedly	1
steadfast	1
hunter	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
this	1
ahab	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
hammock	1
was	1
not	1
the	1

the	1

is	1
as	1
important	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
this	1

the	1
leading	1

of	1
it	1

to	1
be	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
more	1
familiarly	1
enlarged	1
upon	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
adequately	1
understood	1
and	1
moreover	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
any	1
incredulity	1
which	1
a	1
profound	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
subject	1
may	1
induce	1
in	1
some	1
minds	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
verity	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
points	1
of	1
this	1
affair	1
	1
i	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
perform	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
methodically	1
but	1
shall	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
desired	1
impression	1
by	1
separate	1
citations	1
of	1
items	1
practically	1
or	1
reliably	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
whaleman	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
citations	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
the	1
conclusion	1
aimed	1
at	1
will	1
naturally	1
follow	1
of	1
itself	1
	1
first	1
i	1
have	1
personally	1
known	1
three	1
instances	1
where	1
a	1
whale	1
after	1
receiving	1
a	1
harpoon	1
has	1
effected	1
a	1
complete	1
escape	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
in	1
one	1
instance	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
has	1
been	1
again	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
hand	1
and	1
slain	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
irons	1
both	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
private	1
cypher	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
instance	1
where	1
three	1
years	1
intervened	1
between	1
the	1
flinging	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
harpoons	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
darted	1
them	1
happening	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
a	1
trading	1
ship	1
on	1
a	1
voyage	1
to	1
africa	1
went	1
ashore	1
there	1
joined	1
a	1
discovery	1
party	1
and	1
penetrated	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
where	1
he	1
travelled	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
often	1
endangered	1
by	1
serpents	1
savages	1
tigers	1
poisonous	1
miasmas	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
common	1
perils	1
incident	1
to	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
unknown	1
regions	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
whale	1
he	1
had	1
struck	1
must	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
travels	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
had	1
thrice	1
circumnavigated	1
the	1
globe	1
brushing	1
with	1
its	1
flanks	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
africa	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
this	1
whale	1
again	1
came	1
together	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
vanquished	1
the	1
other	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
myself	1
have	1
known	1
three	1
instances	1
similar	1
to	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
whales	1
struck	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
attack	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
irons	1
with	1
the	1
respective	1
marks	1
cut	1
in	1
them	1
afterwards	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
fish	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
year	1
instance	1
it	1
so	1
fell	1
out	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
both	1
times	1
first	1
and	1
last	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
distinctly	1
recognised	1
a	1
peculiar	1
sort	1
of	1
huge	1
mole	1
under	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
eye	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
observed	1
there	1
three	1
years	1
previous	1
i	1
say	1
three	1
years	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
pretty	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
here	1
are	1
three	1
instances	1
then	1
which	1
i	1
personally	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
many	1
other	1
instances	1
from	1
persons	1
whose	1
veracity	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
ground	1
to	1
impeach	1
	1
secondly	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
fishery	1
however	1
ignorant	1
the	1
world	1
ashore	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
several	1
memorable	1
historical	1
instances	1
where	1
a	1
particular	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
ocean	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
distant	1
times	1
and	1
places	1
popularly	1
cognisable	1
why	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
became	1
thus	1
marked	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
and	1
originally	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
bodily	1
peculiarities	1
as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
other	1
whales	1
for	1
however	1
peculiar	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
any	1
chance	1
whale	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
his	1
peculiarities	1
by	1
killing	1
him	1
and	1
boiling	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
valuable	1
oil	1
no	1
the	1
reason	1
was	1
this	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
fatal	1
experiences	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
there	1
hung	1
a	1
terrible	1
prestige	1
of	1
perilousness	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
as	1
there	1
did	1
about	1
rinaldo	1
rinaldini	1
insomuch	1
that	1
most	1
fishermen	1
were	1
content	1
to	1
recognise	1
him	1
by	1
merely	1
touching	1
their	1
tarpaulins	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
discovered	1
lounging	1
by	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
without	1
seeking	1
to	1
cultivate	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
acquaintance	1
like	1
some	1
poor	1
devils	1
ashore	1
that	1
happen	1
to	1
know	1
an	1
irascible	1
great	1
man	1
they	1
make	1
distant	1
unobtrusive	1
salutations	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
lest	1
if	1
they	1
pursued	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
further	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
a	1
summary	1
thump	1
for	1
their	1
presumption	1
	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
famous	1
whales	1
enjoy	1
great	1
individual	1
celebrity	1
nay	1
you	1
may	1
call	1
it	1
an	1
ocean	1
wide	1
renown	1
not	1
only	1

he	1
famous	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
is	1
immortal	1
in	1

mention	1
of	1

two	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
to	1
me	1
seem	1
important	1
as	1
in	1
printed	1
form	1
establishing	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
the	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1

more	1

the	1

of	1
those	1

where	1
truth	1
requires	1
full	1

much	1
bolstering	1
as	1
error	1
so	1
ignorant	1
are	1
most	1
landsmen	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
plainest	1
and	1
most	1
palpable	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
without	1
some	1
hints	1
touching	1
the	1
plain	1
facts	1
historical	1
and	1
otherwise	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
they	1
might	1
scout	1
at	1
moby	1

as	1
a	1
monstrous	1
fable	1
or	1
still	1
worse	1
and	1
more	1
detestable	1
a	1
hideous	1
and	1
intolerable	1
allegory	1
	1
first	1
though	1
most	1
men	1
have	1
some	1
vague	1
flitting	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
fishery	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
like	1
a	1
fixed	1
vivid	1
conception	1
of	1
those	1
perils	1
and	1
the	1
frequency	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
recur	1
one	1
reason	1
perhaps	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
fifty	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
disasters	1
and	1
deaths	1
by	1
casualties	1

that	1

you	1

that	1
that	1
poor	1

this	1

by	1
the	1

do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
that	1
poor	1
fellow	1
s	1
name	1
will	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
newspaper	1
obituary	1
you	1
will	1
read	1
to	1
morrow	1
at	1
your	1
breakfast	1
no	1
because	1
the	1
mails	1
are	1
very	1
irregular	1
between	1
here	1
and	1
new	1
guinea	1
in	1
fact	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
regular	1
news	1
direct	1
or	1
indirect	1
from	1
new	1
guinea	1
yet	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
upon	1
one	1
particular	1
voyage	1
which	1
i	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
pacific	1
among	1
many	1
others	1
we	1
spoke	1
thirty	1
different	1
ships	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
death	1
by	1
a	1
whale	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
and	1
three	1
that	1
had	1
each	1
lost	1
a	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
be	1
economical	1
with	1
your	1
lamps	1
and	1
candles	1
not	1
a	1
gallon	1
you	1
burn	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
man	1
s	1
blood	1
was	1
spilled	1
for	1
it	1
	1
secondly	1
people	1
ashore	1
have	1
indeed	1
some	1
indefinite	1
idea	1
that	1
a	1
whale	1
is	1
an	1
enormous	1
creature	1
of	1
enormous	1
power	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
found	1
that	1
when	1
narrating	1
to	1
them	1
some	1
specific	1
example	1
of	1
this	1
two	1
fold	1
enormousness	1
they	1
have	1
significantly	1
complimented	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
facetiousness	1
when	1
i	1
declare	1
upon	1
my	1
soul	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
idea	1
of	1
being	1
facetious	1
than	1
moses	1
when	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
plagues	1
of	1
egypt	1
	1
but	1
fortunately	1
the	1
special	1
point	1
i	1
here	1
seek	1
can	1
be	1
established	1
upon	1
testimony	1
entirely	1
independent	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
that	1
point	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
sufficiently	1
powerful	1
knowing	1
and	1
judiciously	1
malicious	1
as	1
with	1
direct	1
aforethought	1
to	1
stave	1
in	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
and	1
sink	1
a	1
large	1
ship	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
has	1
done	1
it	1
	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1820	1
the	1
ship	1
essex	1
captain	1
pollard	1
of	1
nantucket	1
was	1
cruising	1
in	1
the	1
pacific	1
ocean	1
one	1
day	1
she	1
saw	1
spouts	1
lowered	1
her	1
boats	1
and	1
gave	1
chase	1
to	1
a	1
shoal	1
of	1
sperm	1
whales	1
ere	1
long	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
were	1
wounded	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
whale	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
boats	1
issued	1
from	1
the	1
shoal	1
and	1
bore	1
directly	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
dashing	1
his	1
forehead	1
against	1
her	1
hull	1
he	1
so	1
stove	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
ten	1
minutes	1
she	1
settled	1
down	1
and	1
fell	1
over	1
not	1
a	1
surviving	1
plank	1
of	1
her	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
since	1
after	1
the	1
severest	1
exposure	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
reached	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
their	1
boats	1
being	1
returned	1
home	1
at	1
last	1
captain	1
pollard	1
once	1
more	1
sailed	1
for	1
the	1
pacific	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
another	1
ship	1
but	1
the	1
gods	1
shipwrecked	1
him	1
again	1
upon	1
unknown	1
rocks	1
and	1
breakers	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
his	1
ship	1
was	1
utterly	1
lost	1
and	1
forthwith	1
forswearing	1
the	1
sea	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
tempted	1
it	1
since	1
at	1
this	1
day	1
captain	1
pollard	1
is	1
a	1
resident	1
of	1
nantucket	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
owen	1
chace	1
who	1
was	1
chief	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
essex	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
his	1
plain	1
and	1
faithful	1
narrative	1
i	1
have	1
conversed	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
miles	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
catastrophe	1
	1
	1
the	1
following	1
are	1
extracts	1
from	1
chace	1
s	1
narrative	1
every	1
fact	1
seemed	1
to	1
warrant	1
me	1
in	1
concluding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
chance	1
which	1
directed	1
his	1
operations	1
he	1
made	1
two	1
several	1
attacks	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
interval	1
between	1
them	1
both	1
of	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
direction	1
were	1
calculated	1
to	1
do	1
us	1
the	1
most	1
injury	1
by	1
being	1
made	1
ahead	1
and	1
thereby	1
combining	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
objects	1
for	1
the	1
shock	1
to	1
effect	1
which	1
the	1
exact	1
manoeuvres	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
were	1
necessary	1
his	1
aspect	1
was	1
most	1
horrible	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
indicated	1
resentment	1
and	1
fury	1
he	1
came	1
directly	1
from	1
the	1
shoal	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
before	1
entered	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
struck	1
three	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
as	1
if	1
fired	1
with	1
revenge	1
for	1
their	1
sufferings	1
again	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
the	1
whole	1
circumstances	1
taken	1
together	1
all	1
happening	1
before	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
producing	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
impressions	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
of	1
decided	1
calculating	1
mischief	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
many	1
of	1
which	1
impressions	1
i	1
cannot	1
now	1
recall	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
correct	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
	1
here	1
are	1
his	1
reflections	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
quitting	1
the	1
ship	1
during	1
a	1
black	1
night	1
in	1
an	1
open	1
boat	1
when	1
almost	1
despairing	1
of	1
reaching	1
any	1
hospitable	1
shore	1
the	1
dark	1
ocean	1
and	1
swelling	1
waters	1
were	1
nothing	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
being	1
swallowed	1
up	1
by	1
some	1
dreadful	1
tempest	1
or	1
dashed	1
upon	1
hidden	1
rocks	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
ordinary	1
subjects	1
of	1
fearful	1
contemplation	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
thought	1
the	1
dismal	1
looking	1
wreck	1
and	1
the	1
horrid	1
aspect	1
and	1
revenge	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
my	1
reflections	1
until	1
day	1
again	1
made	1
its	1
appearance	1
	1
in	1
another	1
place	1
p	1
45	1

speaks	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
and	1
mortal	1
attack	1
of	1

animal	1

	1
secondly	1
the	1
ship	1
union	1
also	1
of	1
nantucket	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1807	1
totally	1
lost	1
off	1
the	1
azores	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
onset	1
but	1
the	1
authentic	1
particulars	1
of	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
chanced	1
to	1
encounter	1
though	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
hunters	1
i	1
have	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
heard	1
casual	1
allusions	1
to	1
it	1
	1
thirdly	1
some	1
eighteen	1
or	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
commodore	1
j	1
then	1
commanding	1
an	1
american	1
sloop	1
of	1
war	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
dining	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
whaling	1
captains	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
nantucket	1
ship	1
in	1
the	1
harbor	1
of	1
oahu	1
sandwich	1
islands	1
conversation	1
turning	1
upon	1
whales	1
the	1
commodore	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
sceptical	1
touching	1
the	1
amazing	1
strength	1
ascribed	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
professional	1
gentlemen	1
present	1
he	1
peremptorily	1
denied	1
for	1
example	1
that	1
any	1
whale	1
could	1
so	1
smite	1
his	1
stout	1
sloop	1
of	1
war	1
as	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
leak	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
thimbleful	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
coming	1
some	1
weeks	1
after	1
the	1
commodore	1
set	1
sail	1
in	1
this	1
impregnable	1
craft	1
for	1
valparaiso	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
a	1
portly	1
sperm	1
whale	1
that	1
begged	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
confidential	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
business	1
consisted	1
in	1
fetching	1
the	1
commodore	1
s	1
craft	1
such	1
a	1
thwack	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
pumps	1
going	1
he	1
made	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
nearest	1
port	1
to	1
heave	1
down	1
and	1
repair	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
superstitious	1
but	1
i	1
consider	1
the	1
commodore	1
s	1
interview	1
with	1
that	1
whale	1
as	1
providential	1
was	1
not	1
saul	1
of	1
tarsus	1
converted	1
from	1
unbelief	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
fright	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
will	1
stand	1
no	1
nonsense	1
	1
i	1
will	1
now	1
refer	1
you	1
to	1
langsdorff	1
s	1
voyages	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
circumstance	1
in	1
point	1
peculiarly	1
interesting	1
to	1
the	1
writer	1
hereof	1
langsdorff	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
russian	1
admiral	1
krusenstern	1
s	1
famous	1
discovery	1
expedition	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
century	1
captain	1
langsdorff	1
thus	1
begins	1
his	1
seventeenth	1
chapter	1
	1
by	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
of	1
may	1
our	1
ship	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sail	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
ochotsh	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
very	1
clear	1
and	1
fine	1
but	1
so	1
intolerably	1
cold	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
keep	1
on	1
our	1
fur	1
clothing	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
we	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
wind	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
that	1
a	1
brisk	1
gale	1
from	1
the	1
northwest	1
sprang	1
up	1
an	1
uncommon	1
large	1
whale	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
larger	1
than	1
the	1
ship	1
itself	1
lay	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
perceived	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
on	1
board	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
sail	1
was	1
almost	1
upon	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
striking	1
against	1
him	1
we	1
were	1
thus	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
imminent	1
danger	1
as	1
this	1
gigantic	1
creature	1
setting	1
up	1
its	1
back	1
raised	1
the	1
ship	1
three	1
feet	1
at	1
least	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
the	1
masts	1
reeled	1
and	1
the	1
sails	1
fell	1
altogether	1
while	1
we	1
who	1
were	1
below	1
all	1
sprang	1
instantly	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
concluding	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
struck	1
upon	1
some	1
rock	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
monster	1
sailing	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
gravity	1
and	1
solemnity	1
captain	1
d	1
wolf	1
applied	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
pumps	1
to	1
examine	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
vessel	1
had	1
received	1
any	1
damage	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
but	1
we	1
found	1
that	1
very	1
happily	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
entirely	1
uninjured	1
	1
now	1
the	1
captain	1
d	1
wolf	1
here	1
alluded	1
to	1
as	1
commanding	1
the	1
ship	1
in	1
question	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
englander	1
who	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
of	1
unusual	1
adventures	1
as	1
a	1
sea	1
captain	1
this	1
day	1
resides	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
dorchester	1
near	1
boston	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
his	1
i	1
have	1
particularly	1
questioned	1
him	1
concerning	1
this	1
passage	1
in	1
langsdorff	1
he	1
substantiates	1
every	1
word	1
the	1
ship	1
however	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
large	1
one	1
a	1
russian	1
craft	1
built	1
on	1
the	1
siberian	1
coast	1
and	1
purchased	1
by	1
my	1
uncle	1
after	1
bartering	1
away	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
home	1
	1
in	1
that	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
manly	1
book	1
of	1
old	1
fashioned	1
adventure	1
so	1
full	1
too	1
of	1
honest	1
wonders	1
the	1
voyage	1
of	1
lionel	1
wafer	1
one	1
of	1
ancient	1
dampier	1
s	1
old	1
chums	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
little	1
matter	1
set	1
down	1
so	1
like	1
that	1
just	1
quoted	1
from	1
langsdorff	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
inserting	1
it	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
corroborative	1
example	1
if	1
such	1
be	1
needed	1
	1
lionel	1
it	1
seems	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
john	1
ferdinando	1
as	1
he	1
calls	1
the	1
modern	1
juan	1
fernandes	1
in	1
our	1
way	1
thither	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
of	1
america	1
our	1
ship	1
felt	1
a	1
terrible	1
shock	1
which	1
put	1
our	1
men	1
in	1
such	1
consternation	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
or	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
began	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
death	1
and	1
indeed	1
the	1
shock	1
was	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
violent	1
that	1
we	1
took	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
struck	1
against	1
a	1
rock	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
amazement	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
over	1
we	1
cast	1
the	1
lead	1
and	1
sounded	1
but	1
found	1
no	1
ground	1
the	1
suddenness	1
of	1
the	1
shock	1
made	1
the	1
guns	1
leap	1
in	1
their	1
carriages	1
and	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
shaken	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hammocks	1
captain	1
davis	1
who	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
a	1
gun	1
was	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
cabin	1
lionel	1
then	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
impute	1
the	1
shock	1
to	1
an	1
earthquake	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
substantiate	1
the	1
imputation	1
by	1
stating	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake	1
somewhere	1
about	1
that	1
time	1
did	1
actually	1
do	1
great	1
mischief	1
along	1
the	1
spanish	1
land	1
but	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
much	1
wonder	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
that	1
early	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
shock	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
caused	1
by	1
an	1
unseen	1
whale	1
vertically	1
bumping	1
the	1
hull	1
from	1
beneath	1
	1
i	1
might	1
proceed	1
with	1
several	1
more	1
examples	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
malice	1
at	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
instance	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
chase	1
the	1
assailing	1
boats	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
ships	1
but	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
ship	1
itself	1
and	1
long	1
withstand	1
all	1
the	1
lances	1
hurled	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
its	1
decks	1
the	1
english	1
ship	1
pusie	1
hall	1
can	1
tell	1
a	1
story	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
strength	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
examples	1
where	1
the	1
lines	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
running	1
sperm	1

	1
in	1

lived	1

in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
justinian	1
was	1

as	1
many	1

wrote	1
the	1

a	1
work	1
every	1
way	1
of	1
uncommon	1
value	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
authorities	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
considered	1
a	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
and	1
unexaggerating	1
historian	1
except	1
in	1
some	1
one	1

two	1

now	1
in	1

procopius	1
mentions	1
that	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
his	1
prefecture	1
at	1
constantinople	1
a	1
great	1
sea	1
monster	1
was	1
captured	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
marmora	1
after	1
having	1
destroyed	1

in	1
those	1

for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
more	1

fifty	1
years	1
a	1
fact	1
thus	1
set	1
down	1
in	1

be	1
gainsaid	1

is	1
there	1
any	1

it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
what	1
precise	1
species	1
this	1
sea	1
monster	1
was	1
is	1
not	1

but	1
as	1
he	1
destroyed	1
ships	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
other	1
reasons	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
whale	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
strongly	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
i	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
unknown	1
in	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
waters	1
connecting	1
with	1
it	1
even	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
certain	1
that	1
those	1
seas	1
are	1
not	1
and	1
perhaps	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
constitution	1
of	1
things	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
his	1
habitual	1
gregarious	1
resort	1
but	1
further	1
investigations	1
have	1
recently	1
proved	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
in	1
modern	1
times	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
isolated	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
i	1
am	1
told	1
on	1
good	1
authority	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
barbary	1
coast	1
a	1
commodore	1
davis	1
of	1
the	1
british	1
navy	1
found	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
of	1
war	1
readily	1
passes	1
through	1
the	1
dardanelles	1
hence	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
could	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
route	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
into	1
the	1
propontis	1
	1
in	1
the	1
propontis	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
learn	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
peculiar	1
substance	1
called	1
brit	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
aliment	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
squid	1
or	1
cuttle	1
fish	1
lurks	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
that	1
sea	1
because	1
large	1
creatures	1
but	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
at	1
its	1
surface	1
if	1
then	1
you	1
properly	1
put	1
these	1
statements	1
together	1
and	1
reason	1
upon	1
them	1
a	1
bit	1
you	1
will	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that	1

to	1
all	1

that	1

were	1
not	1

much	1
more	1

with	1

would	1
be	1
refining	1
too	1
much	1
perhaps	1
even	1
considering	1
his	1
monomania	1
to	1
hint	1
that	1
his	1
vindictiveness	1
towards	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
might	1
have	1
possibly	1
extended	1
itself	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
to	1
all	1
sperm	1
whales	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
monsters	1
he	1
slew	1
by	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
multiplied	1
the	1
chances	1
that	1
each	1
subsequently	1
encountered	1

would	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
hated	1
one	1
he	1
hunted	1
but	1
if	1
such	1
an	1
hypothesis	1
be	1
indeed	1
exceptionable	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
additional	1
considerations	1

though	1
not	1

with	1

of	1

that	1

the	1
subtle	1
insanity	1
of	1
ahab	1
respecting	1

was	1
noways	1
more	1
significantly	1
manifested	1
than	1
in	1

superlative	1
sense	1
and	1
shrewdness	1
in	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
the	1
hunt	1
should	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
be	1
stripped	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
imaginative	1
impiousness	1
which	1
naturally	1
invested	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
must	1
be	1
kept	1
withdrawn	1
into	1
the	1
obscure	1
background	1
for	1
few	1
men	1

courage	1
is	1
proof	1
against	1
protracted	1
meditation	1
unrelieved	1
by	1

that	1
when	1
they	1
stood	1
their	1
long	1
night	1

his	1
officers	1

must	1
have	1
some	1
nearer	1

and	1
impetuously	1
the	1

impulsively	1
it	1

probable	1

somewhat	1
prematurely	1
revealed	1
the	1
prime	1

private	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
voyage	1
ahab	1
was	1
now	1
entirely	1
conscious	1
that	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
he	1
had	1
indirectly	1
laid	1
himself	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
unanswerable	1
charge	1
of	1
usurpation	1
and	1
with	1
perfect	1
impunity	1
both	1
moral	1
and	1
legal	1
his	1
crew	1
if	1
so	1
disposed	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
end	1
competent	1
could	1
refuse	1
all	1
further	1
obedience	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
violently	1
wrest	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
command	1
from	1
even	1
the	1
barely	1
hinted	1
imputation	1
of	1
usurpation	1
and	1
the	1
possible	1
consequences	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
suppressed	1
impression	1
gaining	1
ground	1
ahab	1
must	1
of	1
course	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
protect	1
himself	1
that	1
protection	1
could	1
only	1
consist	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
predominating	1
brain	1
and	1
heart	1
and	1
hand	1
backed	1
by	1
a	1
heedful	1
closely	1
calculating	1
attention	1
to	1
every	1
minute	1
atmospheric	1
influence	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
for	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
reasons	1
then	1
and	1
others	1
perhaps	1
too	1
analytic	1
to	1
be	1
verbally	1
developed	1
here	1
ahab	1
plainly	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
still	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
degree	1
continue	1
true	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
nominal	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
voyage	1
observe	1
all	1
customary	1
usages	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
but	1
force	1
himself	1
to	1
evince	1
all	1
his	1
well	1
known	1
passionate	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
profession	1
	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
now	1
often	1
heard	1
hailing	1
the	1
three	1
mast	1
heads	1
and	1
admonishing	1

an	1

all	1

such	1
an	1

of	1
reverie	1
lurked	1
in	1
the	1

that	1
the	1

dropped	1

at	1

exordium	1
to	1
his	1

here	1
at	1

because	1
he	1
had	1
rather	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
inculcating	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
rowing	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
suppose	1
from	1
this	1
specimen	1
of	1
his	1
sermonizings	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
flew	1
into	1
downright	1
passions	1
with	1
his	1
congregation	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
therein	1
consisted	1
his	1
chief	1
peculiarity	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
the	1
most	1
terrific	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
crew	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
so	1
strangely	1
compounded	1
of	1
fun	1
and	1
fury	1
and	1
the	1
fury	1
seemed	1
so	1
calculated	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
spice	1
to	1
the	1
fun	1
that	1
no	1
oarsman	1
could	1
hear	1
such	1
queer	1
invocations	1
without	1
pulling	1
for	1
dear	1
life	1
and	1
yet	1
pulling	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
joke	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
besides	1
he	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
looked	1
so	1
easy	1
and	1
indolent	1
himself	1
so	1
loungingly	1
managed	1
his	1
steering	1
oar	1
and	1
so	1
broadly	1
gaped	1
open	1
mouthed	1
at	1
times	1
that	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
yawning	1
commander	1
by	1
sheer	1
force	1
of	1
contrast	1
acted	1
like	1
a	1
charm	1
upon	1
the	1
crew	1

one	1
of	1
those	1
odd	1
sort	1
of	1
humorists	1
whose	1
jollity	1
is	1
sometimes	1
so	1
curiously	1
ambiguous	1
as	1
to	1
put	1

the	1

with	1

he	1
withdrew	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hatband	1
where	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
it	1
aslant	1
like	1
a	1
feather	1
he	1
loaded	1
it	1
and	1
rammed	1
home	1
the	1

with	1
his	1
thumb	1
end	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
ignited	1
his	1

across	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

when	1

his	1

whose	1

had	1
been	1
setting	1
to	1

like	1
two	1

suddenly	1
dropped	1
like	1
light	1
from	1
his	1
erect	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
seat	1
crying	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
quick	1

of	1

down	1
down	1

to	1
a	1

no	1
whale	1
nor	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
herring	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
visible	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
troubled	1
bit	1
of	1
greenish	1
white	1
water	1
and	1
thin	1
scattered	1
puffs	1
of	1
vapour	1
hovering	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
suffusingly	1
blowing	1
off	1
to	1
leeward	1
like	1
the	1
confused	1
scud	1
from	1
white	1
rolling	1
billows	1
the	1
air	1
around	1
suddenly	1
vibrated	1
and	1
tingled	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
air	1
over	1
intensely	1
heated	1
plates	1
of	1
iron	1
beneath	1
this	1

waving	1

curling	1
and	1
partially	1
beneath	1
a	1
thin	1
layer	1
of	1
water	1
also	1
the	1
whales	1
were	1
swimming	1
seen	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
indications	1
the	1
puffs	1
of	1
vapour	1
they	1
spouted	1
seemed	1
their	1
forerunning	1
couriers	1
and	1
detached	1
flying	1
outriders	1
	1
all	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
keen	1
pursuit	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
spot	1
of	1
troubled	1
water	1
and	1
air	1
but	1
it	1
bade	1
fair	1
to	1
outstrip	1
them	1
it	1
flew	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
interblending	1
bubbles	1
borne	1
down	1
a	1

his	1

the	1
sharp	1
fixed	1
glance	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
darted	1
straight	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1

almost	1
seemed	1
as	1
two	1
visible	1
needles	1
in	1
two	1
unerring	1

he	1
did	1
not	1

his	1

say	1
anything	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
at	1
intervals	1
startlingly	1
pierced	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
peculiar	1
whispers	1
now	1
harsh	1
with	1
command	1
now	1
soft	1
with	1

pulled	1
his	1

from	1
his	1

stamped	1
up	1

down	1

picking	1

far	1
off	1
upon	1

finally	1
fell	1
to	1
rearing	1

in	1

with	1

of	1
red	1
murder	1
and	1
foam	1
glued	1

ahab	1

after	1
his	1

	1
meanwhile	1
all	1
the	1

tore	1
on	1
the	1
repeated	1
specific	1
allusions	1
of	1
flask	1
to	1
that	1
whale	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
fictitious	1
monster	1
which	1
he	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
incessantly	1
tantalizing	1
his	1
boat	1
s	1
bow	1
with	1
its	1
tail	1
these	1
allusions	1
of	1
his	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
so	1
vivid	1
and	1
life	1
like	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
cause	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
snatch	1
a	1
fearful	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
shoulder	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
against	1
all	1
rule	1
for	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
must	1
put	1
out	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
ram	1
a	1
skewer	1
through	1
their	1
necks	1
usage	1
pronouncing	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
no	1
organs	1
but	1
ears	1
and	1
no	1
limbs	1
but	1
arms	1
in	1
these	1
critical	1
moments	1
	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sight	1
full	1
of	1
quick	1
wonder	1
and	1
awe	1
the	1
vast	1
swells	1
of	1
the	1
omnipotent	1
sea	1
the	1
surging	1
hollow	1
roar	1
they	1
made	1
as	1
they	1
rolled	1
along	1
the	1
eight	1
gunwales	1
like	1
gigantic	1
bowls	1
in	1
a	1
boundless	1
bowling	1
green	1
the	1
brief	1
suspended	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
tip	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
on	1
the	1
knife	1
like	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sharper	1
waves	1
that	1
almost	1
seemed	1
threatening	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
in	1
two	1
the	1
sudden	1
profound	1
dip	1
into	1
the	1
watery	1
glens	1
and	1
hollows	1
the	1
keen	1
spurrings	1
and	1
goadings	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill	1
the	1
headlong	1
sled	1
like	1
slide	1
down	1
its	1
other	1
side	1
all	1
these	1
with	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
headsmen	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
and	1
the	1
shuddering	1
gasps	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
with	1
the	1
wondrous	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
ivory	1
pequod	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
boats	1
with	1
outstretched	1
sails	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
hen	1
after	1
her	1
screaming	1
brood	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
thrilling	1
	1
not	1
the	1
raw	1
recruit	1
marching	1
from	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
fever	1
heat	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
battle	1

encountering	1
the	1

unknown	1
phantom	1
in	1
the	1

neither	1
of	1
these	1
can	1
feel	1
stranger	1

stronger	1
emotions	1
than	1
that	1
man	1
does	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
finds	1
himself	1
pulling	1
into	1
the	1
charmed	1
churned	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
hunted	1
sperm	1
whale	1
	1
the	1
dancing	1
white	1
water	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
chase	1
was	1
now	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
visible	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
increasing	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
dun	1
cloud	1

flung	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1

longer	1
blended	1

tilted	1
everywhere	1

separating	1

apart	1

chase	1
to	1
three	1

running	1
dead	1
to	1
leeward	1
our	1
sail	1
was	1
now	1
set	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
still	1
rising	1
wind	1
we	1
rushed	1
along	1
the	1
boat	1
going	1
with	1
such	1
madness	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
the	1
lee	1
oars	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
worked	1
rapidly	1
enough	1
to	1
escape	1
being	1
torn	1
from	1
the	1
row	1
locks	1
	1
soon	1
we	1
were	1
running	1
through	1
a	1
suffusing	1
wide	1
veil	1
of	1
mist	1
neither	1
ship	1
nor	1
boat	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1

men	1
whispered	1
starbuck	1
drawing	1
still	1
further	1
aft	1
the	1
sheet	1
of	1
his	1
sail	1
there	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
fish	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
squall	1
comes	1
there	1
s	1
white	1
water	1
again	1
close	1
to	1
spring	1
	1
soon	1
after	1
two	1
cries	1
in	1
quick	1
succession	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
us	1
denoted	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
had	1
got	1
fast	1
but	1
hardly	1
were	1
they	1
overheard	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
lightning	1
like	1
hurtling	1
whisper	1
starbuck	1
said	1
stand	1
up	1
and	1
queequeg	1
harpoon	1
in	1
hand	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
	1
though	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
was	1
then	1
facing	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
peril	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
ahead	1
yet	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
intense	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
imminent	1
instant	1
had	1
come	1
they	1
heard	1
too	1
an	1
enormous	1
wallowing	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
fifty	1
elephants	1
stirring	1
in	1
their	1
litter	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
still	1
booming	1
through	1
the	1
mist	1
the	1
waves	1
curling	1
and	1
hissing	1
around	1
us	1
like	1
the	1
erected	1
crests	1
of	1
enraged	1
serpents	1
	1
that	1

starbuck	1
	1
a	1
short	1
rushing	1
sound	1
leaped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
darted	1
iron	1
of	1
queequeg	1
then	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
welded	1
commotion	1
came	1
an	1
invisible	1
push	1
from	1
astern	1
while	1
forward	1
the	1
boat	1
seemed	1
striking	1
on	1
a	1
ledge	1
the	1
sail	1
collapsed	1
and	1
exploded	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
scalding	1
vapour	1
shot	1
up	1
near	1
by	1
something	1
rolled	1
and	1
tumbled	1
like	1
an	1
earthquake	1
beneath	1
us	1
the	1
whole	1
crew	1
were	1
half	1
suffocated	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
tossed	1
helter	1

into	1
the	1
white	1
curdling	1
cream	1
of	1
the	1
squall	1

had	1
all	1
blended	1
together	1
and	1
the	1

merely	1
grazed	1
by	1
the	1
iron	1
escaped	1
	1
though	1
completely	1
swamped	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
nearly	1
unharmed	1
swimming	1
round	1

we	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
floating	1
oars	1
and	1
lashing	1
them	1
across	1
the	1
gunwale	1
tumbled	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
places	1
there	1
we	1
sat	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
water	1
covering	1
every	1
rib	1
and	1
plank	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
our	1
downward	1
gazing	1
eyes	1
the	1
suspended	1
craft	1
seemed	1
a	1
coral	1
boat	1
grown	1
up	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
	1
the	1
wind	1
increased	1
to	1
a	1
howl	1
the	1
waves	1
dashed	1
their	1
bucklers	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
squall	1
roared	1
forked	1
and	1
crackled	1
around	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
prairie	1
in	1
which	1
unconsumed	1
we	1
were	1
burning	1
immortal	1
in	1
these	1
jaws	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
vain	1
we	1
hailed	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
as	1
well	1
roar	1
to	1
the	1
live	1
coals	1
down	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
furnace	1
as	1

those	1

in	1
that	1
storm	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
driving	1
scud	1
rack	1
and	1
mist	1
grew	1
darker	1
with	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
night	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
rising	1
sea	1
forbade	1
all	1
attempts	1
to	1
bale	1
out	1
the	1

the	1

were	1
useless	1
as	1
propellers	1
performing	1
now	1
the	1
office	1
of	1

preservers	1

cutting	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

match	1
keg	1
after	1
many	1
failures	1
starbuck	1
contrived	1
to	1

the	1
lamp	1
in	1
the	1
lantern	1
then	1
stretching	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
waif	1
pole	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
queequeg	1
as	1
the	1
standard	1

of	1
this	1
forlorn	1
hope	1
there	1
then	1
he	1
sat	1
holding	1
up	1
that	1
imbecile	1
candle	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
almighty	1
forlornness	1
there	1

at	1

in	1

upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
scuttling	1
the	1

with	1

considering	1
that	1
the	1
particular	1
disaster	1

was	1
chiefly	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1

driving	1
on	1
to	1
his	1

almost	1
in	1
the	1

that	1
starbuck	1
notwithstanding	1
was	1
famous	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
heedfulness	1
in	1

that	1

for	1

captain	1
to	1
jeopardize	1
that	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
active	1
perils	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
so	1
tamerlane	1
s	1
soldiers	1
often	1
argued	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
whether	1
that	1
invaluable	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
thickest	1
of	1
the	1
fight	1
	1
but	1
with	1
ahab	1
the	1
question	1
assumed	1
a	1
modified	1
aspect	1
considering	1
that	1
with	1
two	1
legs	1
man	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
hobbling	1
wight	1
in	1
all	1
times	1
of	1
danger	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
whales	1
is	1
always	1
under	1
great	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
difficulties	1
that	1
every	1
individual	1
moment	1
indeed	1
then	1
comprises	1
a	1
peril	1
under	1
these	1
circumstances	1
is	1
it	1
wise	1
for	1
any	1
maimed	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
whale	1
boat	1
in	1
the	1
hunt	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing	1
the	1
joint	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
must	1
have	1
plainly	1
thought	1
not	1
	1
ahab	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
although	1
his	1
friends	1
at	1
home	1
would	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
his	1
entering	1
a	1
boat	1
in	1
certain	1
comparatively	1
harmless	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
being	1
near	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action	1
and	1
giving	1
his	1
orders	1
in	1
person	1
yet	1
for	1
captain	1
ahab	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
boat	1
actually	1
apportioned	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
regular	1
headsman	1
in	1
the	1
hunt	1
above	1
all	1
for	1
captain	1
ahab	1
to	1
be	1
supplied	1
with	1
five	1
extra	1
men	1
as	1
that	1
same	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
such	1
generous	1
conceits	1
never	1
entered	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
therefore	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
solicited	1
a	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
from	1
them	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
hinted	1
his	1
desires	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
private	1
measures	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
touching	1
all	1
that	1
matter	1
until	1
cabaco	1
s	1
published	1
discovery	1
the	1
sailors	1
had	1
little	1
foreseen	1
it	1
though	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
when	1
after	1
being	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
out	1
of	1
port	1
all	1
hands	1
had	1
concluded	1
the	1
customary	1
business	1
of	1
fitting	1
the	1
whaleboats	1
for	1
service	1
when	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
this	1
ahab	1
was	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
found	1
bestirring	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
making	1
thole	1
pins	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spare	1
boats	1
and	1
even	1
solicitously	1
cutting	1
the	1
small	1
wooden	1
skewers	1
which	1
when	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
running	1
out	1
are	1
pinned	1
over	1
the	1
groove	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
when	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
observed	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
particularly	1

beneath	1

stroke	1

coffin	1

on	1

arrows	1
the	1

glances	1

the	1
silvery	1

no	1

saw	1
it	1
once	1

not	1
a	1
second	1

	1
this	1
midnight	1
spout	1
had	1
almost	1
grown	1
a	1
forgotten	1
thing	1
when	1
some	1
days	1
after	1
lo	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
silent	1
hour	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
announced	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
descried	1
by	1
all	1
but	1
upon	1
making	1
sail	1
to	1
overtake	1
it	1
once	1
more	1
it	1
disappeared	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
served	1
us	1
night	1
after	1
night	1
till	1
no	1
one	1
heeded	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
it	1
mysteriously	1
jetted	1
into	1
the	1
clear	1
moonlight	1
or	1
starlight	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be	1
disappearing	1
again	1
for	1
one	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
days	1
or	1
three	1
and	1
somehow	1
seeming	1
at	1
every	1
distinct	1
repetition	1
to	1
be	1
advancing	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
in	1
our	1
van	1
this	1
solitary	1
jet	1
seemed	1
for	1
ever	1
alluring	1
us	1
on	1
	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
immemorial	1
superstition	1
of	1
their	1
race	1
and	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
preternaturalness	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
which	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
invested	1
the	1
pequod	1
were	1
there	1
wanting	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
who	1
swore	1
that	1
whenever	1
and	1
wherever	1
descried	1
at	1
however	1
remote	1
times	1
or	1
in	1
however	1
far	1
apart	1
latitudes	1
and	1
longitudes	1
that	1
unnearable	1
spout	1
was	1
cast	1
by	1
one	1
self	1
same	1
whale	1
and	1
that	1
whale	1
moby	1
dick	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
reigned	1
too	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
peculiar	1
dread	1
at	1
this	1
flitting	1
apparition	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
treacherously	1
beckoning	1
us	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
might	1
turn	1
round	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
rend	1
us	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
and	1
most	1
savage	1
seas	1
	1
these	1
temporary	1
apprehensions	1
so	1
vague	1
but	1
so	1
awful	1
derived	1
a	1
wondrous	1
potency	1
from	1
the	1
contrasting	1
serenity	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
in	1
which	1
beneath	1
all	1
its	1
blue	1
blandness	1
some	1
thought	1
there	1
lurked	1
a	1
devilish	1
charm	1
as	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
days	1
we	1
voyaged	1
along	1
through	1
seas	1
so	1
wearily	1
lonesomely	1
mild	1
that	1
all	1
space	1
in	1
repugnance	1
to	1
our	1
vengeful	1
errand	1
seemed	1
vacating	1
itself	1
of	1
life	1
before	1
our	1
urn	1
like	1
prow	1
	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
when	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
eastward	1
the	1
cape	1
winds	1
began	1
howling	1
around	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
long	1
troubled	1
seas	1
that	1
are	1
there	1
when	1
the	1
ivory	1
tusked	1
pequod	1
sharply	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
blast	1
and	1
gored	1
the	1
dark	1
waves	1
in	1
her	1
madness	1
till	1
like	1
showers	1
of	1
silver	1
chips	1
the	1
foam	1
flakes	1
flew	1
over	1
her	1
bulwarks	1
then	1
all	1
this	1
desolate	1
vacuity	1
of	1
life	1
went	1
away	1
but	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
sights	1
more	1
dismal	1
than	1
before	1
	1
close	1
to	1
our	1
bows	1
strange	1
forms	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
darted	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
before	1
us	1
while	1
thick	1
in	1
our	1
rear	1
flew	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
sea	1
ravens	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
perched	1
on	1
our	1
stays	1
rows	1
of	1
these	1
birds	1
were	1
seen	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
our	1
hootings	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
obstinately	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
hemp	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
deemed	1
our	1
ship	1
some	1
drifting	1
uninhabited	1
craft	1
a	1
thing	1
appointed	1
to	1
desolation	1
and	1
therefore	1
fit	1
roosting	1
place	1
for	1
their	1
homeless	1
selves	1
and	1
heaved	1
and	1
heaved	1
still	1
unrestingly	1
heaved	1
the	1
black	1
sea	1
as	1
if	1
its	1
vast	1
tides	1
were	1
a	1
conscience	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
mundane	1
soul	1
were	1
in	1
anguish	1
and	1
remorse	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
sin	1

be	1
destined	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
degree	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
hold	1
true	1
concerning	1
whaling	1
vessels	1
crossing	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
track	1
on	1
the	1
cruising	1
ground	1
itself	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
equally	1
long	1
absent	1
from	1
home	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
transfer	1
of	1
letters	1
from	1
some	1
third	1
and	1
now	1
far	1
remote	1
vessel	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
letters	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
she	1
now	1
meets	1
besides	1
they	1
would	1
exchange	1
the	1
whaling	1
news	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
agreeable	1
chat	1
for	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
they	1
meet	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sympathies	1
of	1
sailors	1
but	1
likewise	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
congenialities	1
arising	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
pursuit	1
and	1
mutually	1
shared	1
privations	1
and	1
perils	1
	1
nor	1
would	1
difference	1
of	1
country	1
make	1
any	1
very	1
essential	1
difference	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
both	1
parties	1
speak	1
one	1
language	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
americans	1
and	1
english	1
though	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
from	1
the	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
english	1
whalers	1
such	1
meetings	1
do	1
not	1
very	1
often	1
occur	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
do	1
occur	1
there	1
is	1
too	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
shyness	1
between	1
them	1
for	1
your	1
englishman	1
is	1
rather	1
reserved	1
and	1
your	1
yankee	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
fancy	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
in	1
anybody	1
but	1
himself	1
besides	1
the	1
english	1
whalers	1
sometimes	1
affect	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
metropolitan	1
superiority	1
over	1
the	1
american	1
whalers	1
regarding	1
the	1
long	1
lean	1
nantucketer	1
with	1
his	1
nondescript	1
provincialisms	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sea	1
peasant	1
but	1
where	1
this	1
superiority	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
whalemen	1
does	1
really	1
consist	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
say	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
yankees	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
collectively	1
kill	1
more	1
whales	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
english	1
collectively	1
in	1
ten	1
years	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
harmless	1
little	1
foible	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
whale	1
hunters	1
which	1
the	1
nantucketer	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
much	1
to	1
heart	1
probably	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
few	1
foibles	1
himself	1
	1
so	1
then	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
ships	1
separately	1
sailing	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
whalers	1
have	1
most	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
sociable	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
whereas	1
some	1
merchant	1
ships	1
crossing	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
wake	1
in	1
the	1
mid	1
atlantic	1
will	1
oftentimes	1
pass	1
on	1
without	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
recognition	1
mutually	1
cutting	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas	1
like	1
a	1
brace	1
of	1
dandies	1
in	1
broadway	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
indulging	1
perhaps	1
in	1
finical	1
criticism	1
upon	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
rig	1
as	1
for	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
when	1
they	1
chance	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
sea	1
they	1
first	1
go	1
through	1
such	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
silly	1
bowings	1
and	1
scrapings	1
such	1
a	1
ducking	1
of	1
ensigns	1
that	1
there	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
right	1
down	1
hearty	1
good	1
will	1
and	1
brotherly	1
love	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
touching	1
slave	1
ships	1
meeting	1
why	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
prodigious	1
hurry	1
they	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
pirates	1
when	1
they	1
chance	1
to	1
cross	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
cross	1
bones	1
the	1
first	1
hail	1
is	1
how	1
many	1
skulls	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
whalers	1
hail	1
how	1
many	1
barrels	1
and	1
that	1
question	1
once	1
answered	1
pirates	1
straightway	1
steer	1
apart	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
infernal	1
villains	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
overmuch	1
of	1
each	1

s	1
villanous	1
likenesses	1
	1
but	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
godly	1
honest	1
unostentatious	1
hospitable	1
sociable	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
whaler	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
whaler	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
meets	1
another	1
whaler	1
in	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
decent	1
weather	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
gam	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
ships	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
even	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
chance	1
they	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
only	1
grin	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
repeat	1
gamesome	1
stuff	1
about	1
spouters	1
and	1
blubber	1
boilers	1
and	1
such	1
like	1
pretty	1
exclamations	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
merchant	1
seamen	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
pirates	1
and	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
s	1
men	1
and	1
slave	1
ship	1
sailors	1
cherish	1
such	1
a	1
scornful	1
feeling	1
towards	1
whale	1
ships	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
answer	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
pirates	1
say	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
that	1
profession	1
of	1
theirs	1
has	1
any	1
peculiar	1
glory	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
sometimes	1
ends	1
in	1
uncommon	1
elevation	1
indeed	1
but	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
gallows	1
and	1
besides	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
elevated	1
in	1
that	1
odd	1
fashion	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
foundation	1
for	1
his	1
superior	1
altitude	1
hence	1
i	1
conclude	1
that	1
in	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
high	1
lifted	1
above	1
a	1
whaleman	1
in	1
that	1
assertion	1
the	1
pirate	1
has	1
no	1
solid	1
basis	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
gam	1
you	1
might	1
wear	1
out	1
your	1
index	1
finger	1
running	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
columns	1
of	1
dictionaries	1
and	1
never	1
find	1
the	1
word	1
dr	1
johnson	1
never	1
attained	1
to	1
that	1
erudition	1
noah	1
webster	1
s	1
ark	1
does	1
not	1
hold	1
it	1
nevertheless	1
this	1
same	1
expressive	1
word	1
has	1
now	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
been	1
in	1
constant	1
use	1
among	1
some	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
true	1
born	1
yankees	1
certainly	1
it	1
needs	1
a	1
definition	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
incorporated	1
into	1
the	1
lexicon	1
with	1
that	1
view	1
let	1
me	1
learnedly	1
define	1
it	1
	1
gam	1
noun	1
a	1
social	1
meeting	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
whaleships	1
generally	1
on	1
a	1
cruising	1
ground	1
when	1
after	1
exchanging	1
hails	1
they	1
exchange	1
visits	1
by	1
boats	1
crews	1
the	1
two	1
captains	1
remaining	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
one	1
ship	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
chief	1
mates	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
little	1
item	1
about	1
gamming	1
which	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
here	1
all	1
professions	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
little	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
detail	1
so	1
has	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery	1
in	1
a	1
pirate	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
or	1
slave	1
ship	1
when	1
the	1
captain	1
is	1
rowed	1
anywhere	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
he	1
always	1
sits	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
sheets	1
on	1
a	1
comfortable	1
sometimes	1
cushioned	1
seat	1
there	1
and	1
often	1
steers	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
milliner	1
s	1
tiller	1
decorated	1
with	1
gay	1
cords	1
and	1
ribbons	1
but	1
the	1
whale	1
boat	1
has	1
no	1
seat	1
astern	1
no	1
sofa	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
whatever	1
and	1
no	1
tiller	1
at	1
all	1
high	1
times	1
indeed	1
if	1
whaling	1
captains	1
were	1
wheeled	1
about	1
the	1
water	1
on	1
castors	1
like	1
gouty	1
old	1
aldermen	1
in	1
patent	1
chairs	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
tiller	1
the	1
whale	1
boat	1
never	1
admits	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
effeminacy	1
and	1
therefore	1
as	1
in	1
gamming	1
a	1
complete	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
must	1
leave	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
hence	1
as	1
the	1
boat	1
steerer	1
or	1
harpooneer	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
that	1
subordinate	1
is	1
the	1
steersman	1
upon	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
having	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
is	1
pulled	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
visit	1
all	1
standing	1
like	1
a	1
pine	1
tree	1
and	1
often	1
you	1
will	1
notice	1
that	1
being	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
visible	1
world	1
resting	1
on	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ships	1
this	1
standing	1
captain	1
is	1
all	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
sustaining	1
his	1
dignity	1
by	1
maintaining	1
his	1
legs	1
nor	1
is	1
this	1
any	1
very	1
easy	1
matter	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
rear	1
is	1
the	1
immense	1
projecting	1
steering	1
oar	1
hitting	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
of	1
his	1
back	1
the	1
after	1
oar	1
reciprocating	1
by	1
rapping	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
front	1
he	1
is	1
thus	1
completely	1
wedged	1
before	1
and	1
behind	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
expand	1
himself	1
sideways	1
by	1
settling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
stretched	1
legs	1
but	1
a	1
sudden	1
violent	1
pitch	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
will	1
often	1
go	1
far	1
to	1
topple	1
him	1
because	1
length	1
of	1
foundation	1
is	1
nothing	1
without	1
corresponding	1
breadth	1
merely	1
make	1
a	1
spread	1
angle	1
of	1
two	1
poles	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
stand	1
them	1
up	1
then	1
again	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
in	1
plain	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
s	1
riveted	1
eyes	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
i	1
say	1
for	1
this	1
straddling	1
captain	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
steadying	1
himself	1
the	1
slightest	1
particle	1
by	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
anything	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
indeed	1
as	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
buoyant	1
self	1
command	1
he	1
generally	1
carries	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
trowsers	1
pockets	1
but	1
perhaps	1
being	1
generally	1
very	1
large	1
heavy	1
hands	1
he	1
carries	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
ballast	1
nevertheless	1
there	1
have	1
occurred	1
instances	1
well	1
authenticated	1
ones	1
too	1
where	1
the	1

has	1
been	1
known	1
for	1
an	1
uncommonly	1
critical	1
moment	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
a	1

the	1

now	1
wildly	1
heightened	1
by	1
a	1
circumstance	1
of	1

which	1
seemed	1
obscurely	1

certain	1
wondrous	1
inverted	1
visitation	1
of	1

of	1

its	1

what	1

the	1
secret	1

of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
about	1
to	1

narrated	1

of	1

unknown	1
to	1
the	1

of	1

himself	1

was	1
the	1
private	1
property	1
of	1
three	1
confederate	1
white	1
seamen	1
of	1
that	1

of	1
whom	1
it	1
seems	1
communicated	1
it	1
to	1
tashtego	1
with	1
romish	1

of	1
secrecy	1
but	1
the	1
following	1
night	1
tashtego	1
rambled	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
and	1
revealed	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
wakened	1

could	1
not	1
well	1

affair	1
i	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
lasting	1
record	1
	1
	1
the	1
ancient	1
whale	1
cry	1
upon	1
first	1
sighting	1
a	1
whale	1
from	1
the	1
mast	1
head	1
still	1
used	1
by	1
whalemen	1
in	1
hunting	1
the	1
famous	1
gallipagos	1
terrapin	1
	1
	1
for	1
my	1
humor	1
s	1
sake	1
i	1
shall	1
preserve	1
the	1
style	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
once	1
narrated	1
it	1
at	1
lima	1
to	1
a	1
lounging	1
circle	1
of	1
my	1
spanish	1
friends	1
one	1
saint	1
s	1
eve	1
smoking	1
upon	1
the	1
thick	1
gilt	1
tiled	1
piazza	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
inn	1
of	1
those	1
fine	1
cavaliers	1
the	1
young	1
dons	1
pedro	1
and	1
sebastian	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
closer	1
terms	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
interluding	1
questions	1
they	1
occasionally	1
put	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
duly	1
answered	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
	1
some	1
two	1
years	1
prior	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
learning	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
about	1
rehearsing	1
to	1
you	1
gentlemen	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
sperm	1
whaler	1
of	1
nantucket	1
was	1
cruising	1
in	1
your	1
pacific	1
here	1
not	1
very	1
many	1
days	1
sail	1
eastward	1
from	1
the	1
eaves	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
golden	1
inn	1
she	1
was	1
somewhere	1
to	1
the	1
northward	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
one	1
morning	1
upon	1
handling	1
the	1
pumps	1
according	1
to	1
daily	1
usage	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
more	1
water	1
in	1
her	1
hold	1
than	1
common	1
they	1
supposed	1
a	1
sword	1
fish	1
had	1
stabbed	1
her	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
the	1
captain	1
having	1
some	1
unusual	1
reason	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
rare	1
good	1
luck	1
awaited	1
him	1
in	1
those	1
latitudes	1
and	1
therefore	1
being	1
very	1
averse	1
to	1
quit	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
leak	1
not	1
being	1
then	1
considered	1
at	1
all	1
dangerous	1
though	1
indeed	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
after	1
searching	1
the	1
hold	1
as	1
low	1
down	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
in	1
rather	1
heavy	1
weather	1
the	1
ship	1
still	1
continued	1
her	1
cruisings	1
the	1
mariners	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
at	1
wide	1
and	1
easy	1
intervals	1
but	1
no	1
good	1
luck	1
came	1
more	1
days	1
went	1
by	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
leak	1
yet	1
undiscovered	1
but	1
it	1
sensibly	1
increased	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
now	1
taking	1
some	1
alarm	1
the	1
captain	1
making	1
all	1
sail	1
stood	1
away	1
for	1
the	1
nearest	1
harbor	1
among	1
the	1
islands	1
there	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
hull	1
hove	1
out	1
and	1
repaired	1
	1
though	1
no	1
small	1
passage	1
was	1
before	1
her	1
yet	1
if	1
the	1
commonest	1
chance	1
favoured	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
fear	1
that	1
his	1
ship	1
would	1
founder	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
because	1
his	1
pumps	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
being	1
periodically	1
relieved	1
at	1
them	1
those	1
six	1
and	1
thirty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
could	1
easily	1
keep	1
the	1
ship	1
free	1
never	1
mind	1
if	1
the	1
leak	1
should	1
double	1
on	1
her	1
in	1
truth	1
well	1
nigh	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
passage	1
being	1
attended	1
by	1
very	1
prosperous	1
breezes	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
certainly	1
arrived	1
in	1
perfect	1
safety	1
at	1
her	1
port	1
without	1
the	1
occurrence	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
fatality	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
brutal	1
overbearing	1
of	1
radney	1
the	1
mate	1
a	1
vineyarder	1
and	1
the	1
bitterly	1
provoked	1

quite	1

indeed	1
might	1

by	1

only	1
tempered	1
by	1
that	1
common	1
decency	1
of	1
human	1
recognition	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
meanest	1
slave	1
s	1
right	1
thus	1
treated	1
this	1
steelkilt	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
retained	1
harmless	1
and	1
docile	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
so	1
thus	1
far	1
but	1
radney	1
was	1
doomed	1
and	1
made	1
mad	1
and	1
steelkilt	1
but	1
gentlemen	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
at	1
the	1
furthest	1
after	1
pointing	1
her	1
prow	1
for	1
her	1
island	1
haven	1
that	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
s	1
leak	1
seemed	1
again	1
increasing	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
require	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
every	1
day	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
settled	1
and	1
civilized	1
ocean	1
like	1
our	1
atlantic	1
for	1
example	1
some	1
skippers	1
think	1
little	1
of	1
pumping	1
their	1
whole	1
way	1
across	1
it	1
though	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
sleepy	1
night	1
should	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
happen	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
the	1
probability	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
shipmates	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
remember	1
it	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
hands	1
gently	1
subsiding	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
solitary	1
and	1
savage	1
seas	1
far	1
from	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
westward	1
gentlemen	1
is	1
it	1
altogether	1
unusual	1
for	1
ships	1
to	1
keep	1
clanging	1
at	1
their	1
pump	1
handles	1
in	1
full	1
chorus	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
considerable	1
length	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
it	1
lie	1
along	1
a	1
tolerably	1
accessible	1
coast	1
or	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
reasonable	1
retreat	1
is	1
afforded	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
when	1
a	1
leaky	1
vessel	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
very	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
part	1
of	1
those	1
waters	1
some	1
really	1
landless	1
latitude	1
that	1
her	1
captain	1
begins	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
little	1
anxious	1
	1
much	1
this	1
way	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
with	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
so	1
when	1
her	1
leak	1
was	1
found	1
gaining	1
once	1
more	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
truth	1
some	1
small	1
concern	1
manifested	1
by	1
several	1
of	1
her	1
company	1
especially	1
by	1
radney	1
the	1
mate	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
upper	1
sails	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
hoisted	1
sheeted	1
home	1
anew	1
and	1
every	1
way	1
expanded	1
to	1
the	1
breeze	1
now	1
this	1
radney	1
i	1
suppose	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
of	1
a	1
coward	1
and	1
as	1
little	1
inclined	1
to	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
nervous	1
apprehensiveness	1
touching	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
as	1
any	1
fearless	1
unthinking	1
creature	1
on	1
land	1
or	1
on	1
sea	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
conveniently	1
imagine	1
gentlemen	1
therefore	1
when	1
he	1
betrayed	1
this	1
solicitude	1
about	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
seamen	1
declared	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
part	1
owner	1
in	1
her	1
so	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
working	1
that	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
no	1
small	1
gamesomeness	1
slily	1
going	1
on	1
among	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
continually	1
overflowed	1
by	1
the	1
rippling	1
clear	1
water	1
clear	1
as	1
any	1
mountain	1
spring	1
gentlemen	1
that	1
bubbling	1
from	1
the	1
pumps	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
poured	1
itself	1
out	1
in	1
steady	1
spouts	1
at	1
the	1
lee	1
scupper	1
holes	1
	1
now	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
seldom	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
this	1
conventional	1
world	1
of	1
ours	1
watery	1
or	1
otherwise	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
person	1
placed	1
in	1
command	1
over	1
his	1
fellow	1
men	1
finds	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
significantly	1
his	1
superior	1
in	1
general	1
pride	1
of	1
manhood	1
straightway	1
against	1
that	1
man	1
he	1
conceives	1
an	1
unconquerable	1
dislike	1
and	1
bitterness	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
he	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
and	1
pulverize	1
that	1
subaltern	1

and	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1

conceit	1
of	1
mine	1
as	1

forward	1

panting	1

sat	1
himself	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
windlass	1
his	1
face	1
fiery	1
red	1
his	1
eyes	1
bloodshot	1
and	1
wiping	1
the	1
profuse	1
sweat	1
from	1
his	1
brow	1
now	1
what	1
cozening	1
fiend	1
it	1
was	1
gentlemen	1
that	1
possessed	1
radney	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
corporeally	1
exasperated	1
state	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
happened	1
intolerably	1
striding	1
along	1
the	1
deck	1
the	1
mate	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
broom	1
and	1
sweep	1
down	1
the	1
planks	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
shovel	1
and	1
remove	1
some	1
offensive	1
matters	1
consequent	1
upon	1
allowing	1
a	1
pig	1
to	1
run	1
at	1
large	1
	1
now	1
gentlemen	1
sweeping	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
deck	1
at	1
sea	1
is	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
household	1
work	1
which	1
in	1
all	1
times	1
but	1
raging	1
gales	1
is	1
regularly	1
attended	1
to	1
every	1
evening	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
ships	1
actually	1
foundering	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
such	1
gentlemen	1
is	1
the	1
inflexibility	1
of	1
sea	1
usages	1
and	1
the	1
instinctive	1
love	1
of	1
neatness	1
in	1
seamen	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
would	1
not	1
willingly	1
drown	1
without	1
first	1
washing	1
their	1
faces	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
vessels	1
this	1
broom	1
business	1
is	1
the	1
prescriptive	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
if	1
boys	1
there	1
be	1
aboard	1
besides	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
stronger	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
into	1
gangs	1
taking	1
turns	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
and	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
athletic	1
seaman	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
steelkilt	1
had	1
been	1
regularly	1
assigned	1
captain	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gangs	1
consequently	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
freed	1
from	1
any	1
trivial	1
business	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
truly	1
nautical	1
duties	1
such	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
his	1
comrades	1
i	1
mention	1
all	1
these	1
particulars	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
understand	1
exactly	1
how	1
this	1
affair	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
this	1
the	1
order	1
about	1
the	1
shovel	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
plainly	1
meant	1
to	1
sting	1
and	1
insult	1
steelkilt	1
as	1
though	1
radney	1
had	1
spat	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
gone	1
sailor	1
in	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
will	1
understand	1
this	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
doubtless	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
lakeman	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
when	1
the	1
mate	1
uttered	1
his	1
command	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
still	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
steadfastly	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
mate	1
s	1
malignant	1
eye	1
and	1
perceived	1
the	1
stacks	1
of	1
powder	1
casks	1
heaped	1
up	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
slow	1
match	1
silently	1
burning	1
along	1
towards	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
instinctively	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
strange	1
forbearance	1
and	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
deeper	1
passionateness	1
in	1
any	1
already	1
ireful	1
being	1
a	1
repugnance	1
most	1
felt	1
when	1
felt	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
really	1
valiant	1
men	1
even	1
when	1
aggrieved	1
this	1
nameless	1
phantom	1
feeling	1
gentlemen	1
stole	1
over	1
steelkilt	1
	1
therefore	1
in	1
his	1
ordinary	1
tone	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
bodily	1
exhaustion	1
he	1
was	1
temporarily	1
in	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
saying	1
that	1
sweeping	1
the	1
deck	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
business	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
shovel	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
three	1
lads	1
as	1
the	1
customary	1
sweepers	1
who	1
not	1
being	1
billeted	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
had	1
done	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
all	1
day	1
to	1
this	1
radney	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
domineering	1
and	1
outrageous	1
manner	1
unconditionally	1
reiterating	1
his	1
command	1
meanwhile	1
advancing	1
upon	1
the	1
still	1
seated	1
lakeman	1
with	1
an	1
uplifted	1
cooper	1
s	1
club	1
hammer	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
snatched	1
from	1
a	1
cask	1
near	1
by	1
	1
heated	1
and	1
irritated	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
his	1
spasmodic	1
toil	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
first	1
nameless	1
feeling	1
of	1
forbearance	1
the	1
sweating	1
steelkilt	1
could	1
but	1
ill	1
brook	1
this	1
bearing	1
in	1
the	1
mate	1
but	1
somehow	1
still	1
smothering	1
the	1
conflagration	1
within	1
him	1
without	1
speaking	1
he	1
remained	1
doggedly	1
rooted	1
to	1
his	1
seat	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
incensed	1
radney	1
shook	1
the	1
hammer	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
furiously	1
commanding	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
bidding	1
	1
steelkilt	1
rose	1
and	1
slowly	1
retreating	1
round	1
the	1
windlass	1
steadily	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
mate	1
with	1
his	1
menacing	1
hammer	1
deliberately	1
repeated	1
his	1
intention	1
not	1
to	1
obey	1
seeing	1
however	1
that	1
his	1
forbearance	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
effect	1
by	1
an	1
awful	1
and	1
unspeakable	1
intimation	1
with	1
his	1
twisted	1
hand	1
he	1
warned	1
off	1
the	1
foolish	1
and	1
infatuated	1
man	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
two	1
went	1
once	1
slowly	1
round	1
the	1
windlass	1
when	1
resolved	1
at	1
last	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
retreat	1
bethinking	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
forborne	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
comported	1
with	1
his	1
humor	1
the	1
lakeman	1
paused	1
on	1
the	1
hatches	1
and	1
thus	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
	1
mr	1
radney	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
you	1
take	1
that	1
hammer	1
away	1
or	1
look	1
to	1
yourself	1
but	1
the	1
predestinated	1
mate	1
coming	1
still	1
closer	1
to	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
lakeman	1
stood	1
fixed	1
now	1
shook	1
the	1
heavy	1
hammer	1
within	1
an	1
inch	1
of	1
his	1
teeth	1
meanwhile	1
repeating	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
insufferable	1
maledictions	1
retreating	1
not	1
the	1
thousandth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
stabbing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
with	1
the	1
unflinching	1
poniard	1
of	1
his	1
glance	1
steelkilt	1
clenching	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
creepingly	1
drawing	1
it	1
back	1
told	1
his	1
persecutor	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
hammer	1
but	1
grazed	1
his	1
cheek	1
he	1
steelkilt	1
would	1
murder	1
him	1
but	1
gentlemen	1
the	1
fool	1
had	1
been	1
branded	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter	1
by	1
the	1
gods	1
immediately	1
the	1
hammer	1
touched	1
the	1
cheek	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
stove	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
hatch	1
spouting	1
blood	1
like	1
a	1
whale	1
	1
ere	1
the	1
cry	1
could	1
go	1
aft	1
steelkilt	1
was	1
shaking	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
backstays	1
leading	1
far	1
aloft	1

of	1

the	1

captain	1
danced	1
up	1

down	1
with	1
a	1
whale	1
pike	1
calling	1
upon	1
his	1
officers	1
to	1

that	1
atrocious	1
scoundrel	1
and	1
smoke	1
him	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1

at	1
intervals	1
he	1
ran	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
revolving	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
confusion	1
and	1
prying	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
pike	1
sought	1
to	1
prick	1
out	1
the	1
object	1
of	1

steelkilt	1
and	1
his	1
desperadoes	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them	1
all	1
they	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
the	1

up	1

down	1
there	1
defied	1
the	1
worst	1
the	1
pistols	1
could	1
do	1
but	1
gave	1
the	1
captain	1
to	1
understand	1
distinctly	1
that	1
his	1
steelkilt	1
s	1
death	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
a	1
murderous	1
mutiny	1
on	1

in	1

a	1
little	1

the	1

to	1

of	1
them	1
were	1
against	1

but	1
at	1
length	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
steelkilt	1
they	1
preceded	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
their	1
dark	1
den	1
growlingly	1
disappearing	1
like	1
bears	1
into	1
a	1
cave	1
	1
as	1
the	1
lakeman	1
s	1
bare	1
head	1
was	1
just	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
planks	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
posse	1
leaped	1
the	1
barricade	1
and	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
over	1
the	1
slide	1
of	1
the	1
scuttle	1
planted	1
their	1
group	1
of	1
hands	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
loudly	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
steward	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
heavy	1
brass	1
padlock	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
companionway	1
	1
then	1
opening	1
the	1
slide	1
a	1
little	1
the	1
captain	1
whispered	1
something	1
down	1
the	1
crack	1
closed	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
them	1
ten	1
in	1
number	1
leaving	1
on	1
deck	1
some	1
twenty	1
or	1
more	1
who	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
remained	1
neutral	1
	1
all	1
night	1
a	1
wide	1
awake	1
watch	1
was	1
kept	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
forward	1
and	1
aft	1
especially	1
about	1
the	1
forecastle	1
scuttle	1
and	1
fore	1
hatchway	1
at	1
which	1
last	1
place	1
it	1
was	1
feared	1
the	1
insurgents	1
might	1
emerge	1
after	1
breaking	1
through	1
the	1
bulkhead	1
below	1
but	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
darkness	1
passed	1
in	1
peace	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
still	1
remained	1
at	1
their	1
duty	1
toiling	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
pumps	1
whose	1
clinking	1
and	1
clanking	1
at	1
intervals	1
through	1
the	1
dreary	1
night	1
dismally	1
resounded	1
through	1
the	1
ship	1
	1
at	1
sunrise	1
the	1
captain	1
went	1
forward	1
and	1
knocking	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
summoned	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
work	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
yell	1
they	1
refused	1
water	1
was	1
then	1
lowered	1
down	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
handfuls	1
of	1
biscuit	1
were	1
tossed	1
after	1
it	1
when	1
again	1
turning	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
pocketing	1
it	1
the	1
captain	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
twice	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
this	1
was	1
repeated	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
morning	1
a	1
confused	1
wrangling	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
scuffling	1
was	1
heard	1
as	1
the	1
customary	1
summons	1
was	1
delivered	1
and	1
suddenly	1
four	1
men	1
burst	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
forecastle	1
saying	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
fetid	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
a	1
famishing	1
diet	1
united	1
perhaps	1
to	1
some	1
fears	1
of	1
ultimate	1
retribution	1
had	1
constrained	1
them	1
to	1
surrender	1
at	1
discretion	1
emboldened	1
by	1
this	1
the	1
captain	1
reiterated	1
his	1
demand	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
but	1
steelkilt	1
shouted	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
terrific	1
hint	1
to	1
stop	1
his	1
babbling	1
and	1
betake	1
himself	1
where	1
he	1
belonged	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
morning	1
three	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
bolted	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
desperate	1
arms	1
below	1
that	1
sought	1
to	1
restrain	1
them	1
only	1
three	1
were	1
left	1
	1
better	1
turn	1
to	1
now	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
a	1
heartless	1
jeer	1
	1
shut	1
us	1
up	1
again	1
will	1
ye	1
cried	1
steelkilt	1
	1
oh	1
certainly	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
clicked	1
	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
gentlemen	1
that	1
enraged	1
by	1
the	1
defection	1
of	1
seven	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
associates	1
and	1
stung	1
by	1
the	1
mocking	1
voice	1
that	1
had	1
last	1
hailed	1
him	1
and	1
maddened	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
entombment	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
despair	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
steelkilt	1
proposed	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
canallers	1
thus	1
far	1
apparently	1
of	1
one	1
mind	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hole	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
summoning	1
of	1
the	1
garrison	1
and	1
armed	1
with	1
their	1
keen	1
mincing	1
knives	1
long	1
crescentic	1
heavy	1
implements	1
with	1
a	1
handle	1
at	1
each	1
end	1
run	1
amuck	1
from	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
to	1
the	1
taffrail	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
devilishness	1
of	1
desperation	1
possible	1
seize	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
whether	1
they	1
joined	1
him	1
or	1
not	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
night	1
he	1
should	1
spend	1
in	1
that	1
den	1
but	1
the	1
scheme	1
met	1
with	1
no	1
opposition	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
they	1
swore	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
that	1
or	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
mad	1
thing	1
for	1
anything	1
in	1
short	1
but	1
a	1
surrender	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
they	1
each	1
insisted	1
upon	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
on	1
deck	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
rush	1
should	1
come	1
but	1
to	1
this	1
their	1
leader	1
as	1
fiercely	1
objected	1
reserving	1
that	1
priority	1
for	1
himself	1
particularly	1
as	1
his	1
two	1
comrades	1
would	1
not	1
yield	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
first	1
for	1
the	1
ladder	1
would	1
but	1
admit	1
one	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
here	1
gentlemen	1
the	1
foul	1
play	1
of	1
these	1
miscreants	1
must	1
come	1
out	1
	1
upon	1
hearing	1
the	1
frantic	1
project	1
of	1
their	1
leader	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
separate	1

suddenly	1
lighted	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
upon	1
the	1

piece	1
of	1
treachery	1
namely	1
to	1
be	1
foremost	1
in	1
breaking	1
out	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
three	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
ten	1
to	1

and	1
thereby	1
secure	1
whatever	1

chance	1
of	1
pardon	1
such	1
conduct	1
might	1
merit	1
but	1
when	1
steelkilt	1
made	1
known	1
his	1
determination	1
still	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
they	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
by	1
some	1
subtle	1
chemistry	1
of	1
villany	1
mixed	1
their	1
before	1
secret	1
treacheries	1
together	1
and	1
when	1
their	1
leader	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
doze	1
verbally	1
opened	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
three	1
sentences	1
and	1
bound	1
the	1
sleeper	1
with	1
cords	1
and	1
gagged	1
him	1
with	1
cords	1
and	1
shrieked	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
captain	1
at	1
midnight	1
	1
thinking	1
murder	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
smelling	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
armed	1
mates	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
rushed	1
for	1
the	1
forecastle	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
scuttle	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
the	1
still	1
struggling	1
ringleader	1
was	1
shoved	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
his	1
perfidious	1
allies	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
claimed	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
securing	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
fully	1
ripe	1
for	1
murder	1
but	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
collared	1
and	1
dragged	1
along	1
the	1
deck	1
like	1
dead	1
cattle	1
and	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
were	1
seized	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mizzen	1
rigging	1
like	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
meat	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
hung	1
till	1
morning	1
damn	1
ye	1
cried	1
the	1
captain	1
pacing	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
before	1
them	1
the	1
vultures	1
would	1
not	1
touch	1
ye	1
ye	1
villains	1
	1
at	1
sunrise	1
he	1
summoned	1
all	1
hands	1
and	1
separating	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
rebelled	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
mutiny	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
former	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
mind	1
to	1
flog	1
them	1
all	1
round	1
thought	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
justice	1
demanded	1
it	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
considering	1
their	1
timely	1
surrender	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
reprimand	1
which	1
he	1
accordingly	1
administered	1
in	1
the	1
vernacular	1
	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
you	1
ye	1
carrion	1
rogues	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
rigging	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
mince	1
ye	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
try	1
pots	1
and	1
seizing	1
a	1
rope	1
he	1
applied	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
to	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
traitors	1
till	1
they	1
yelled	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
lifelessly	1
hung	1
their	1
heads	1
sideways	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
crucified	1
thieves	1
are	1
drawn	1
	1
my	1
wrist	1
is	1
sprained	1
with	1
ye	1
he	1
cried	1
at	1
last	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
rope	1
enough	1
left	1
for	1
you	1
my	1
fine	1
bantam	1
that	1
wouldn	1
t	1
give	1
up	1
take	1
that	1
gag	1
from	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
himself	1
	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
exhausted	1
mutineer	1
made	1
a	1
tremulous	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
cramped	1
jaws	1
and	1
then	1
painfully	1
twisting	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
hiss	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
is	1
this	1
and	1
mind	1
it	1
well	1
if	1
you	1
flog	1
me	1
i	1
murder	1
you	1
	1
say	1
ye	1
so	1
then	1
see	1
how	1
ye	1
frighten	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
drew	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
to	1
strike	1
	1
best	1
not	1
hissed	1
the	1
lakeman	1
	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
and	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
drawn	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
stroke	1
	1
steelkilt	1
here	1
hissed	1
out	1
something	1
inaudible	1
to	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
captain	1
who	1
to	1
the	1
amazement	1
of	1
all	1
hands	1
started	1
back	1
paced	1
the	1
deck	1
rapidly	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
throwing	1
down	1
his	1
rope	1
said	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
cut	1
him	1
down	1
d	1
ye	1
hear	1
	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
junior	1
mates	1
were	1
hurrying	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
order	1
a	1
pale	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
head	1
arrested	1
them	1
radney	1
the	1
chief	1
mate	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
blow	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
his	1
berth	1
but	1
that	1
morning	1
hearing	1
the	1
tumult	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
had	1
crept	1
out	1
and	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
whole	1
scene	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
speak	1
but	1
mumbling	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
being	1
willing	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
captain	1
dared	1
not	1
attempt	1
he	1
snatched	1
the	1
rope	1
and	1
advanced	1
to	1
his	1
pinioned	1
foe	1
	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
coward	1
hissed	1
the	1
lakeman	1
	1
so	1
i	1
am	1
but	1
take	1
that	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
striking	1
when	1
another	1
hiss	1
stayed	1
his	1
uplifted	1
arm	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
then	1
pausing	1
no	1
more	1
made	1
good	1
his	1
word	1
spite	1
of	1
steelkilt	1
s	1
threat	1
whatever	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
three	1
men	1
were	1
then	1
cut	1
down	1
all	1
hands	1
were	1
turned	1
to	1
and	1
sullenly	1
worked	1
by	1
the	1
moody	1
seamen	1
the	1
iron	1
pumps	1
clanged	1
as	1
before	1
	1
just	1
after	1
dark	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
one	1
watch	1
had	1
retired	1
below	1
a	1
clamor	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
trembling	1
traitors	1
running	1
up	1
besieged	1
the	1
cabin	1
door	1
saying	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
consort	1
with	1
the	1
crew	1
entreaties	1
cuffs	1
and	1
kicks	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
back	1
so	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
instance	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
run	1
for	1
salvation	1
still	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
mutiny	1
reappeared	1
among	1
the	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
mainly	1
at	1
steelkilt	1
s	1
instigation	1
they	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
strictest	1
peacefulness	1
obey	1
all	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
reached	1
port	1
desert	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
but	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
insure	1
the	1
speediest	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
voyage	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
another	1
thing	1
namely	1
not	1
to	1
sing	1
out	1
for	1
whales	1
in	1
case	1
any	1
should	1
be	1
discovered	1
for	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
leak	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
perils	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
still	1
maintained	1
her	1
mast	1
heads	1
and	1
her	1
captain	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
willing	1
to	1
lower	1
for	1
a	1
fish	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
his	1
craft	1
first	1
struck	1
the	1
cruising	1
ground	1
and	1
radney	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
berth	1
for	1
a	1
boat	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
bandaged	1
mouth	1
seek	1
to	1
gag	1
in	1
death	1
the	1
vital	1
jaw	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
lakeman	1
had	1
induced	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
adopt	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
passiveness	1
in	1
their	1
conduct	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
own	1
counsel	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
all	1
was	1
over	1
concerning	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
and	1
private	1
revenge	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
stung	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ventricles	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
radney	1
the	1
chief	1
mate	1
s	1
watch	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
infatuated	1
man	1
sought	1
to	1
run	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
doom	1
after	1
the	1
scene	1
at	1
the	1
rigging	1
he	1
insisted	1
against	1
the	1
express	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
upon	1
resuming	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
watch	1
at	1
night	1
upon	1
this	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
circumstances	1
steelkilt	1
systematically	1
built	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
his	1
revenge	1
	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
radney	1
had	1
an	1
unseamanlike	1
way	1
of	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
of	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
arm	1
upon	1
the	1
gunwale	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
which	1
was	1
hoisted	1
up	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
in	1
this	1
attitude	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
he	1
sometimes	1
dozed	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
vacancy	1
between	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
down	1
between	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
sea	1
steelkilt	1
calculated	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
next	1
trick	1
at	1
the	1
helm	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
at	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
from	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
betrayed	1
at	1
his	1
leisure	1
he	1
employed	1
the	1
interval	1
in	1
braiding	1
something	1
very	1
carefully	1
in	1
his	1
watches	1
below	1
	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
there	1
said	1
a	1
shipmate	1
	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
	1
like	1
a	1
lanyard	1
for	1
your	1
bag	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
odd	1
one	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
	1
yes	1
rather	1
oddish	1
said	1
the	1
lakeman	1
holding	1
it	1
at	1
arm	1
s	1
length	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
answer	1
shipmate	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
enough	1
twine	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
	1
then	1
i	1
must	1
get	1
some	1
from	1
old	1
rad	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
aft	1
	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
begging	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
a	1
sailor	1
	1
why	1
not	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
turn	1
when	1
it	1
s	1
to	1
help	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
shipmate	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
mate	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
quietly	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
twine	1
to	1
mend	1
his	1
hammock	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
neither	1
twine	1
nor	1
lanyard	1
were	1
seen	1
again	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
night	1
an	1
iron	1
ball	1
closely	1
netted	1
partly	1
rolled	1
from	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
the	1
lakeman	1
s	1
monkey	1

as	1
he	1
was	1
tucking	1
the	1
coat	1
into	1
his	1
hammock	1
for	1
a	1
pillow	1
twenty	1
four	1
hours	1
after	1
his	1
trick	1
at	1
the	1
silent	1
helm	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
doze	1
over	1
the	1
grave	1
always	1
ready	1
dug	1
to	1
the	1
seaman	1

that	1

was	1
then	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fore	1
ordaining	1

of	1

the	1

was	1
already	1
stark	1

the	1

so	1
suddenly	1
perceiving	1
the	1

whale	1
within	1
fifty	1
yards	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
forgetful	1
of	1
the	1

among	1
the	1

in	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
teneriffe	1
man	1
had	1
instinctively	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
lifted	1
his	1
voice	1
for	1
the	1
monster	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
past	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
plainly	1
beheld	1
from	1

a	1
phrensy	1
the	1

whale	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
was	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
captain	1
mates	1
and	1
harpooneers	1
who	1
undeterred	1
by	1
fearful	1
rumours	1
were	1
all	1
anxious	1
to	1
capture	1
so	1
famous	1
and	1
precious	1
a	1
fish	1
while	1
the	1
dogged	1
crew	1
eyed	1
askance	1
and	1
with	1
curses	1
the	1
appalling	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
milky	1
mass	1
that	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
horizontal	1
spangling	1
sun	1
shifted	1
and	1
glistened	1
like	1
a	1
living	1
opal	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
morning	1
sea	1
gentlemen	1
a	1
strange	1
fatality	1
pervades	1
the	1
whole	1
career	1
of	1
these	1
events	1
as	1
if	1
verily	1
mapped	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
was	1
charted	1
the	1
mutineer	1
was	1
the	1
bowsman	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
and	1
when	1
fast	1
to	1
a	1
fish	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
sit	1
next	1
him	1
while	1
radney	1
stood	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
lance	1
in	1
the	1
prow	1
and	1
haul	1
in	1
or	1
slacken	1
the	1
line	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
moreover	1
when	1
the	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
lowered	1
the	1
mate	1
s	1
got	1
the	1
start	1
and	1
none	1
howled	1
more	1
fiercely	1
with	1
delight	1
than	1
did	1
steelkilt	1
as	1
he	1
strained	1
at	1
his	1
oar	1
after	1
a	1
stiff	1
pull	1
their	1
harpooneer	1
got	1
fast	1
and	1
spear	1
in	1
hand	1
radney	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
bow	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
furious	1
man	1
it	1
seems	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
and	1
now	1
his	1
bandaged	1
cry	1
was	1
to	1
beach	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
topmost	1
back	1
nothing	1
loath	1
his	1
bowsman	1
hauled	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
up	1
through	1
a	1
blinding	1
foam	1
that	1
blent	1
two	1
whitenesses	1
together	1
till	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
the	1
boat	1
struck	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
sunken	1
ledge	1
and	1
keeling	1
over	1
spilled	1
out	1
the	1
standing	1
mate	1
that	1
instant	1
as	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
slippery	1
back	1
the	1
boat	1
righted	1
and	1
was	1
dashed	1
aside	1
by	1
the	1
swell	1
while	1
radney	1
was	1
tossed	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
he	1
struck	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
spray	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
was	1
dimly	1
seen	1
through	1
that	1
veil	1
wildly	1
seeking	1
to	1
remove	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
moby	1
dick	1
but	1
the	1
whale	1
rushed	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
maelstrom	1
seized	1
the	1
swimmer	1
between	1
his	1
jaws	1
and	1
rearing	1
high	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
plunged	1
headlong	1
again	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
	1
meantime	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
tap	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
bottom	1
the	1
lakeman	1
had	1
slackened	1
the	1
line	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
drop	1
astern	1
from	1
the	1
whirlpool	1
calmly	1
looking	1
on	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
but	1
a	1
sudden	1
terrific	1
downward	1
jerking	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
quickly	1
brought	1
his	1
knife	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
he	1
cut	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
free	1
but	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
moby	1
dick	1
rose	1
again	1
with	1
some	1
tatters	1
of	1
radney	1
s	1
red	1
woollen	1
shirt	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
that	1
had	1
destroyed	1
him	1
all	1
four	1
boats	1
gave	1
chase	1
again	1
but	1
the	1
whale	1
eluded	1
them	1
and	1
finally	1
wholly	1
disappeared	1
	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
the	1
town	1
ho	1
reached	1
her	1
port	1
a	1
savage	1
solitary	1
place	1
where	1
no	1
civilized	1
creature	1
resided	1
there	1
headed	1
by	1
the	1
lakeman	1
all	1
but	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
of	1
the	1
foremastmen	1
deliberately	1
deserted	1
among	1
the	1
palms	1
eventually	1
as	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
seizing	1
a	1
large	1
double	1
war	1
canoe	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
and	1
setting	1
sail	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
harbor	1
	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
company	1
being	1
reduced	1
to	1
but	1
a	1
handful	1
the	1
captain	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
islanders	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
laborious	1
business	1
of	1
heaving	1
down	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
leak	1
but	1
to	1
such	1
unresting	1
vigilance	1
over	1
their	1
dangerous	1
allies	1
was	1
this	1
small	1
band	1
of	1
whites	1
necessitated	1
both	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
so	1
extreme	1
was	1
the	1
hard	1
work	1
they	1
underwent	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
vessel	1
being	1
ready	1
again	1
for	1
sea	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
weakened	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
durst	1
not	1
put	1
off	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
heavy	1
a	1
vessel	1
after	1
taking	1
counsel	1
with	1
his	1
officers	1
he	1
anchored	1
the	1
ship	1
as	1
far	1
off	1
shore	1
as	1
possible	1
loaded	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
his	1
two	1
cannon	1
from	1
the	1
bows	1
stacked	1
his	1
muskets	1
on	1
the	1
poop	1
and	1
warning	1
the	1
islanders	1
not	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
ship	1
at	1
their	1
peril	1
took	1
one	1
man	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
setting	1
the	1
sail	1
of	1
his	1
best	1
whale	1
boat	1
steered	1
straight	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
for	1
tahiti	1
five	1
hundred	1
miles	1
distant	1
to	1
procure	1
a	1
reinforcement	1
to	1
his	1
crew	1
	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
sail	1
a	1
large	1
canoe	1
was	1
descried	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
isle	1
of	1
corals	1
he	1
steered	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
savage	1
craft	1
bore	1
down	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
steelkilt	1
hailed	1
him	1
to	1
heave	1
to	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
run	1
him	1
under	1
water	1
the	1
captain	1
presented	1
a	1
pistol	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
on	1
each	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
yoked	1
war	1
canoes	1
the	1
lakeman	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
pistol	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
clicked	1
in	1
the	1
lock	1
he	1
would	1
bury	1
him	1
in	1
bubbles	1
and	1
foam	1
	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
cried	1
the	1
captain	1
	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
bound	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
bound	1
demanded	1
steelkilt	1
no	1
lies	1
	1
i	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
tahiti	1
for	1
more	1
men	1
	1
very	1
good	1
let	1
me	1
board	1
you	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
come	1
in	1
peace	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
canoe	1
swam	1
to	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
climbing	1
the	1
gunwale	1
stood	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
captain	1
	1
cross	1
your	1
arms	1
sir	1
throw	1
back	1
your	1
head	1
now	1
repeat	1
after	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
steelkilt	1
leaves	1
me	1
i	1
swear	1
to	1
beach	1
this	1
boat	1
on	1
yonder	1
island	1
and	1
remain	1
there	1
six	1
days	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
may	1
lightning	1
strike	1
me	1
	1
a	1
pretty	1
scholar	1
laughed	1
the	1
lakeman	1
adios	1
senor	1
and	1
leaping	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
he	1
swam	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
comrades	1
	1
watching	1
the	1
boat	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
fairly	1
beached	1
and	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
cocoa	1
nut	1
trees	1
steelkilt	1
made	1
sail	1
again	1
and	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
arrived	1
at	1
tahiti	1
his	1
own	1
place	1
of	1
destination	1
there	1
luck	1
befriended	1
him	1
two	1
ships	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
france	1
and	1
were	1
providentially	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
precisely	1
that	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
which	1
the	1
sailor	1
headed	1
they	1
embarked	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
ever	1
got	1
the	1
start	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
captain	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
minded	1
to	1
work	1
them	1
legal	1

	1
some	1
ten	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
french	1
ships	1
sailed	1
the	1
whale	1
boat	1
arrived	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
enlist	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
civilized	1
tahitians	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
somewhat	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
chartering	1
a	1
small	1
native	1
schooner	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
his	1

finding	1
all	1
right	1
there	1
again	1
resumed	1

i	1
shall	1
ere	1

paint	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
well	1
as	1

without	1

something	1
like	1
the	1
true	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
he	1
actually	1
appears	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
whaleman	1
when	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
absolute	1
body	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
moored	1
alongside	1

so	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
fairly	1
stepped	1
upon	1
there	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
worth	1
while	1
therefore	1
previously	1
to	1
advert	1
to	1
those	1
curious	1
imaginary	1
portraits	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
even	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
confidently	1
challenge	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
landsman	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
right	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
by	1
proving	1
such	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
all	1
wrong	1
	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
primal	1

of	1
all	1
those	1

delusions	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
the	1

about	1

that	1

i	1
do	1
not	1

to	1
seem	1
inelegant	1

this	1

looks	1
much	1

an	1

as	1
for	1
the	1

one	1
glimpse	1
at	1

enough	1

the	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1

whence	1

these	1
manifold	1
mistakes	1
in	1

not	1

very	1

after	1
all	1

most	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
drawings	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1

and	1
these	1
are	1
about	1
as	1
correct	1
as	1
a	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
wrecked	1
ship	1
with	1
broken	1

would	1
correctly	1

its	1
undashed	1
pride	1
of	1

elephants	1

stood	1
for	1
their	1
full	1
lengths	1
the	1
living	1
leviathan	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
fairly	1
floated	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
portrait	1
the	1
living	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
majesty	1
and	1
significance	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
sea	1
in	1
unfathomable	1
waters	1
and	1
afloat	1
the	1
vast	1
bulk	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
like	1
a	1
launched	1
line	1
of	1
battle	1
ship	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
element	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
eternally	1
impossible	1
for	1
mortal	1
man	1
to	1
hoist	1
him	1
bodily	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
preserve	1
all	1
his	1
mighty	1
swells	1
and	1
undulations	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
highly	1
presumable	1
difference	1
of	1
contour	1
between	1
a	1
young	1
sucking	1
whale	1
and	1
a	1
full	1

platonian	1
leviathan	1

even	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
those	1

whales	1
hoisted	1
to	1

that	1
his	1
precise	1
expression	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
catch	1
	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fancied	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
naked	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
stranded	1
whale	1
accurate	1
hints	1
may	1
be	1
derived	1
touching	1
his	1
true	1
form	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
curious	1
things	1
about	1
this	1
leviathan	1
that	1
his	1
skeleton	1
gives	1
very	1
little	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
shape	1
though	1

for	1
candelabra	1
in	1
the	1

conveys	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
burly	1
browed	1
utilitarian	1
old	1
gentleman	1
with	1
all	1
jeremy	1

other	1
leading	1
personal	1
characteristics	1

nothing	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
could	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
any	1
leviathan	1
s	1
articulated	1
bones	1
in	1
fact	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
hunter	1
says	1
the	1
mere	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
bears	1
the	1
same	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
fully	1
invested	1

padded	1
animal	1
as	1
the	1
insect	1

to	1
the	1

curiously	1
displayed	1

which	1
you	1

	1
on	1

numbers	1
of	1

secure	1
from	1

of	1
a	1
sperm	1
whaler	1
like	1
the	1
pequod	1
with	1

that	1
manner	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1

that	1
escaped	1
at	1

advance	1
their	1
scythes	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
wet	1
grass	1
of	1
marshy	1
meads	1
even	1
so	1
these	1
monsters	1
swam	1
making	1
a	1
strange	1
grassy	1
cutting	1
sound	1
and	1
leaving	1
behind	1
them	1
endless	1
swaths	1
of	1

upon	1

do	1
because	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
shallows	1

soundings	1
there	1

because	1
of	1
this	1
remarkable	1
meadow	1
like	1
appearance	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
vast	1
drifts	1
of	1
brit	1
continually	1
floating	1
in	1
those	1
latitudes	1
where	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
is	1
often	1
chased	1
	1
	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
sound	1
they	1
made	1
as	1
they	1
parted	1
the	1
brit	1
which	1
at	1
all	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
mowers	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
mast	1
heads	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
paused	1
and	1
were	1
stationary	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
their	1
vast	1
black	1
forms	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
lifeless	1
masses	1
of	1
rock	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
hunting	1
countries	1
of	1
india	1
the	1
stranger	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1

sometimes	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1

them	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
taking	1
them	1
for	1
bare	1
blackened	1
elevations	1
of	1
the	1
soil	1
even	1
so	1
often	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
beholds	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
leviathans	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
recognised	1
at	1
last	1
their	1
immense	1
magnitude	1
renders	1
it	1
very	1
hard	1
really	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
such	1
bulky	1
masses	1
of	1
overgrowth	1
can	1
possibly	1
be	1
instinct	1
in	1
all	1
parts	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
lives	1
in	1
a	1
dog	1
or	1
a	1
horse	1
	1
indeed	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
regard	1
any	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
for	1
though	1
some	1
old	1
naturalists	1
have	1
maintained	1
that	1
all	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
are	1
of	1
their	1
kind	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
though	1
taking	1
a	1
broad	1
general	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
this	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
yet	1
coming	1
to	1
specialties	1
where	1
for	1
example	1
does	1
the	1
ocean	1
furnish	1
any	1
fish	1
that	1
in	1
disposition	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
sagacious	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
the	1
accursed	1
shark	1
alone	1
can	1
in	1
any	1
generic	1
respect	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
bear	1
comparative	1
analogy	1
to	1
him	1
	1
but	1
though	1
to	1
landsmen	1
in	1
general	1
the	1
native	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
regarded	1
with	1
emotions	1
unspeakably	1
unsocial	1

repelling	1

the	1

in	1

have	1

that	1
a	1

of	1
it	1
being	1
so	1
very	1

that	1
circumstance	1
has	1
gone	1
far	1
to	1
invest	1
it	1
with	1
portentousness	1
so	1
rarely	1
is	1
it	1
beheld	1
that	1
though	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
declare	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
largest	1
animated	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
ocean	1
yet	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
any	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
vague	1
ideas	1
concerning	1
its	1
true	1
nature	1
and	1
form	1
notwithstanding	1
they	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
furnish	1
to	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
his	1
only	1
food	1
for	1
though	1
other	1
species	1
of	1
whales	1
find	1
their	1
food	1
above	1

may	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1

obtains	1
his	1
whole	1

in	1
unknown	1
zones	1
below	1
the	1

and	1
only	1
by	1
inference	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
can	1
tell	1
of	1
what	1
precisely	1
that	1
food	1
consists	1
at	1
times	1
when	1
closely	1
pursued	1
he	1
will	1
disgorge	1
what	1
are	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
detached	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1

some	1
of	1
them	1
thus	1
exhibited	1
exceeding	1
twenty	1

thirty	1
feet	1

fancy	1
that	1
the	1

to	1
which	1
these	1

belonged	1
ordinarily	1
clings	1
by	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
unlike	1
other	1
species	1
is	1
supplied	1
with	1
teeth	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
tear	1
it	1
	1
there	1
seems	1
some	1
ground	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
kraken	1
of	1
bishop	1

may	1
ultimately	1
resolve	1
itself	1
into	1
squid	1

manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1

describes	1
it	1
as	1
alternately	1
rising	1

sinking	1
with	1
some	1

much	1
abatement	1
is	1
necessary	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
incredible	1
bulk	1
he	1
assigns	1
it	1
	1

indeed	1
in	1

here	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
magical	1

whale	1
line	1
	1
the	1
line	1
originally	1
used	1
in	1
the	1

was	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hemp	1
slightly	1
vapoured	1
with	1
tar	1
not	1
impregnated	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
ordinary	1
ropes	1
for	1
while	1
tar	1
as	1
ordinarily	1
used	1
makes	1
the	1
hemp	1
more	1
pliable	1
to	1
the	1
rope	1
maker	1
and	1
also	1
renders	1
the	1
rope	1
itself	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
the	1
sailor	1
for	1
common	1
ship	1
use	1
yet	1
not	1
only	1
would	1
the	1
ordinary	1
quantity	1
too	1
much	1
stiffen	1
the	1
whale	1
line	1
for	1
the	1
close	1
coiling	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
subjected	1
but	1
as	1
most	1
seamen	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
learn	1
tar	1
in	1
general	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
adds	1
to	1
the	1
rope	1

durability	1
or	1
strength	1

much	1
it	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
compactness	1
and	1
gloss	1
	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
the	1
manilla	1
rope	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
american	1
fishery	1
almost	1
entirely	1
superseded	1
hemp	1
as	1
a	1
material	1
for	1
whale	1
lines	1
for	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
durable	1
as	1

it	1
is	1
stronger	1

more	1

elastic	1

there	1
is	1

in	1

to	1

forward	1
the	1

upon	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

further	1

the	1

the	1

through	1
sundry	1
mystifications	1
too	1
tedious	1
to	1
detail	1
	1
thus	1
the	1
whale	1

folds	1
the	1
whole	1

in	1
its	1
complicated	1
coils	1

writhing	1
around	1

almost	1

involved	1
in	1
its	1
perilous	1
contortions	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
timid	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
landsman	1
they	1
seem	1
as	1
indian	1
jugglers	1
with	1
the	1

snakes	1
sportively	1
festooning	1

he	1

be	1
thus	1
circumstanced	1
without	1

that	1
makes	1
the	1
very	1

in	1
his	1
bones	1
to	1
quiver	1
in	1
him	1
like	1
a	1

over	1
the	1
half	1

white	1
cedar	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
boat	1
when	1
thus	1
hung	1
in	1

the	1

with	1

as	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
	1
perhaps	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
thought	1
will	1
now	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
those	1
repeated	1
whaling	1
disasters	1
some	1
few	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
casually	1
chronicled	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
or	1
that	1
man	1
being	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
lost	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
line	1
is	1
darting	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
like	1
being	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
whizzings	1
of	1
a	1
steam	1
engine	1
in	1
full	1
play	1
when	1
every	1
flying	1
beam	1
and	1
shaft	1
and	1
wheel	1
is	1
grazing	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
cannot	1
sit	1
motionless	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
these	1
perils	1
because	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
rocking	1
like	1
a	1
cradle	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
pitched	1
one	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
warning	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
self	1
adjusting	1
buoyancy	1
and	1
simultaneousness	1
of	1
volition	1
and	1
action	1
can	1
you	1
escape	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
mazeppa	1
of	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
where	1
the	1
all	1
seeing	1
sun	1
himself	1
could	1
never	1
pierce	1
you	1
out	1
	1
again	1
as	1
the	1
profound	1
calm	1
which	1
only	1
apparently	1
precedes	1
and	1
prophesies	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
is	1
perhaps	1
more	1
awful	1
than	1
the	1
storm	1
itself	1
for	1
indeed	1
the	1
calm	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
wrapper	1
and	1
envelope	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
and	1
contains	1
it	1
in	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
seemingly	1
harmless	1
rifle	1
holds	1
the	1
fatal	1
powder	1
and	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
the	1
explosion	1
so	1
the	1
graceful	1
repose	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
as	1
it	1
silently	1
serpentines	1
about	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
before	1
being	1
brought	1
into	1
actual	1
play	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
carries	1
more	1
of	1
true	1
terror	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
aspect	1
of	1
this	1
dangerous	1
affair	1

why	1

all	1

all	1
are	1
born	1

only	1
when	1

death	1
that	1
mortals	1
realize	1
the	1
silent	1

in	1
what	1

an	1

no	1

it	1
in	1
that	1

losing	1
all	1

went	1
out	1

after	1
the	1

withdrawn	1
	1
ere	1
forgetfulness	1
altogether	1
came	1
over	1

had	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
seamen	1
at	1
the	1
main	1
and	1
mizzen	1
mast	1
heads	1
were	1
already	1
drowsy	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
lifelessly	1
swung	1
from	1
the	1
spars	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
swing	1
that	1
we	1
made	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nod	1
from	1
below	1
from	1
the	1
slumbering	1
helmsman	1
the	1
waves	1
too	1
nodded	1
their	1
indolent	1

and	1
across	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

nodded	1
to	1
west	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
over	1
all	1
	1
suddenly	1
bubbles	1
seemed	1
bursting	1
beneath	1
my	1
closed	1
eyes	1
like	1

my	1
hands	1
grasped	1
the	1

some	1
invisible	1
gracious	1
agency	1
preserved	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
shock	1
i	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
lo	1
close	1
under	1
our	1
lee	1
not	1
forty	1
fathoms	1
off	1
a	1
gigantic	1
sperm	1
whale	1
lay	1
rolling	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
like	1
the	1
capsized	1
hull	1
of	1
a	1
frigate	1
his	1
broad	1
glossy	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
ethiopian	1
hue	1
glistening	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1

like	1
a	1
mirror	1
but	1
lazily	1
undulating	1
in	1
the	1
trough	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
ever	1
and	1
anon	1
tranquilly	1
spouting	1
his	1
vapoury	1
jet	1
the	1
whale	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
portly	1
burgher	1
smoking	1
his	1
pipe	1
of	1
a	1
warm	1
afternoon	1
but	1
that	1

poor	1

was	1
thy	1

the	1
sleepy	1
ship	1

every	1
sleeper	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
started	1
into	1
wakefulness	1

more	1

simultaneously	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
notes	1
from	1
aloft	1
shouted	1
forth	1
the	1
accustomed	1
cry	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
fish	1
slowly	1
and	1
regularly	1
spouted	1
the	1
sparkling	1
brine	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
	1
clear	1
away	1
the	1
boats	1
luff	1
cried	1
ahab	1
and	1
obeying	1
his	1
own	1
order	1
he	1
dashed	1
the	1
helm	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
helmsman	1
could	1
handle	1
the	1
spokes	1
	1
the	1
sudden	1
exclamations	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
must	1
have	1
alarmed	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
ere	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
down	1
majestically	1
turning	1
he	1
swam	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
leeward	1
but	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
steady	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
making	1
so	1
few	1
ripples	1
as	1
he	1
swam	1
that	1
thinking	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
be	1
alarmed	1
ahab	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
not	1
an	1
oar	1
should	1
be	1
used	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
must	1
speak	1
but	1
in	1
whispers	1
so	1
seated	1
like	1
ontario	1
indians	1
on	1
the	1
gunwales	1
of	1
the	1
boats	1
we	1
swiftly	1
but	1
silently	1
paddled	1
along	1
the	1
calm	1
not	1
admitting	1
of	1
the	1
noiseless	1
sails	1
being	1
set	1
presently	1
as	1
we	1
thus	1
glided	1
in	1
chase	1
the	1
monster	1
perpendicularly	1
flitted	1
his	1
tail	1
forty	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
then	1
sank	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
like	1
a	1
tower	1
swallowed	1
up	1
	1
there	1
go	1
flukes	1
was	1
the	1
cry	1
an	1
announcement	1
immediately	1
followed	1
by	1
stubb	1
s	1
producing	1
his	1
match	1
and	1
igniting	1
his	1
pipe	1
for	1
now	1
a	1
respite	1
was	1
granted	1
after	1
the	1
full	1
interval	1
of	1
his	1
sounding	1
had	1
elapsed	1
the	1
whale	1
rose	1
again	1
and	1
being	1
now	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
smoker	1

and	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
stubb	1
counted	1
upon	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
capture	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
had	1
at	1
length	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
pursuers	1
all	1
silence	1

cautiousness	1

therefore	1
no	1
longer	1
of	1

came	1
loudly	1
into	1

still	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
pipe	1
stubb	1
cheered	1
on	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
the	1
assault	1
	1
yes	1
a	1
mighty	1
change	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
the	1
fish	1
all	1
alive	1
to	1
his	1
jeopardy	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
head	1
out	1

part	1
obliquely	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
mad	1
yeast	1

he	1
brewed	1

is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
buoyant	1

about	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
with	1
ease	1
he	1
elevates	1
it	1
in	1
the	1

invariably	1
does	1
so	1
when	1
going	1
at	1

by	1

the	1

caught	1
two	1
additional	1

with	1

	1
partly	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
indispensableness	1
of	1
this	1
act	1
it	1
may	1
here	1
be	1
stated	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
dutch	1
fishery	1
a	1
mop	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
dash	1
the	1
running	1
line	1
with	1
water	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
ships	1
a	1
wooden	1
piggin	1

apart	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
your	1
hat	1
however	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
convenient	1
	1
	1
from	1
the	1
vibrating	1
line	1
extending	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
now	1
being	1
more	1
tight	1
than	1
a	1
harpstring	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
the	1
craft	1
had	1
two	1
keels	1
one	1
cleaving	1
the	1
water	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
the	1
boat	1
churned	1
on	1
through	1
both	1
opposing	1
elements	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
continual	1
cascade	1
played	1
at	1
the	1
bows	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
whirling	1
eddy	1
in	1
her	1

at	1
the	1

motion	1
from	1
within	1
even	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
finger	1
the	1
vibrating	1
cracking	1
craft	1
canted	1
over	1
her	1
spasmodic	1
gunwale	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
thus	1
they	1
rushed	1
each	1
man	1
with	1
might	1
and	1
main	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
seat	1
to	1
prevent	1
being	1
tossed	1
to	1
the	1
foam	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
form	1
of	1
tashtego	1
at	1
the	1
steering	1

crouching	1
almost	1
double	1

bring	1
down	1
his	1

of	1

whole	1
atlantics	1

seemed	1
passed	1
as	1
they	1
shot	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
till	1
at	1
length	1
the	1

somewhat	1
slackened	1
his	1
flight	1

cried	1
stubb	1
to	1
the	1
bowsman	1
and	1
facing	1
round	1
towards	1
the	1
whale	1
all	1
hands	1
began	1
pulling	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
while	1
yet	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
being	1
towed	1
on	1
soon	1
ranging	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
flank	1

firmly	1
planting	1
his	1

in	1
the	1

into	1

at	1
the	1

alternately	1
sterning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
horrible	1
wallow	1
and	1
then	1
ranging	1
up	1
for	1
another	1
fling	1
	1
the	1
red	1
tide	1
now	1
poured	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
like	1
brooks	1
down	1
a	1
hill	1
his	1
tormented	1
body	1
rolled	1
not	1
in	1
brine	1
but	1
in	1
blood	1
which	1
bubbled	1
and	1
seethed	1
for	1
furlongs	1
behind	1
in	1
their	1
wake	1
the	1
slanting	1
sun	1
playing	1
upon	1
this	1
crimson	1
pond	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
sent	1
back	1
its	1
reflection	1
into	1
every	1
face	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
glowed	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
red	1
men	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
jet	1
after	1
jet	1
of	1
white	1
smoke	1
was	1
agonizingly	1
shot	1
from	1
the	1
spiracle	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
vehement	1
puff	1
after	1
puff	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
excited	1
headsman	1
as	1
at	1
every	1
dart	1
hauling	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
crooked	1
lance	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
attached	1
to	1
it	1
stubb	1
straightened	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
rapid	1
blows	1
against	1
the	1
gunwale	1
then	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
sent	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
whale	1
	1
pull	1
up	1
pull	1
up	1
he	1
now	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1

as	1
the	1
waning	1
whale	1
relaxed	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
pull	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
and	1
the	1

ranged	1
along	1
the	1
fish	1
s	1
flank	1
when	1
reaching	1
far	1
over	1
the	1
bow	1
stubb	1
slowly	1
churned	1
his	1
long	1
sharp	1
lance	1
into	1
the	1
fish	1
and	1
kept	1
it	1
there	1
carefully	1
churning	1
and	1
churning	1
as	1
if	1
cautiously	1
seeking	1
to	1
feel	1
after	1
some	1
gold	1
watch	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
might	1
have	1
swallowed	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fearful	1
of	1
breaking	1
ere	1
he	1
could	1
hook	1
it	1
out	1
but	1
that	1
gold	1
watch	1
he	1
sought	1
was	1
the	1
innermost	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
struck	1
for	1
starting	1
from	1
his	1
trance	1
into	1
that	1
unspeakable	1
thing	1
called	1
his	1
flurry	1
the	1
monster	1
horribly	1
wallowed	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
overwrapped	1
himself	1
in	1
impenetrable	1
mad	1
boiling	1
spray	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
imperilled	1
craft	1
instantly	1
dropping	1
astern	1
had	1
much	1
ado	1
blindly	1
to	1
struggle	1
out	1
from	1
that	1
phrensied	1
twilight	1
into	1
the	1
clear	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
	1
and	1
now	1
abating	1
in	1
his	1
flurry	1
the	1
whale	1
once	1
more	1
rolled	1
out	1
into	1
view	1
surging	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
spasmodically	1
dilating	1
and	1
contracting	1
his	1
spout	1
hole	1
with	1
sharp	1
cracking	1
agonized	1
respirations	1
at	1
last	1
gush	1

gush	1

into	1

at	1

is	1
when	1

all	1
this	1
is	1
both	1

the	1

should	1
stay	1
in	1

should	1

long	1
experience	1
in	1

it	1
has	1
not	1

up	1

as	1
a	1

is	1
a	1
doubling	1
of	1

it	1
very	1

happens	1
that	1
owing	1

the	1

violent	1

running	1
of	1
the	1

some	1
of	1

who	1
have	1
a	1
genuine	1
relish	1
for	1
that	1

designated	1
by	1
stubb	1
comprising	1
the	1
tapering	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
	1
about	1
midnight	1
that	1

lighted	1

stoutly	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
spermaceti	1
supper	1
at	1
the	1
capstan	1

as	1
if	1
that	1

were	1

the	1
only	1
banqueter	1
on	1

that	1
night	1
mingling	1
their	1
mumblings	1
with	1

mastications	1
thousands	1
on	1
thousands	1
of	1
sharks	1
swarming	1
round	1
the	1
dead	1
leviathan	1
smackingly	1
feasted	1
on	1
its	1
fatness	1
the	1
few	1
sleepers	1
below	1
in	1
their	1
bunks	1
were	1
often	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
sharp	1
slapping	1
of	1
their	1
tails	1
against	1
the	1
hull	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
the	1
sleepers	1
hearts	1
peering	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
you	1
could	1
just	1
see	1
them	1
as	1
before	1
you	1
heard	1
them	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
sullen	1
black	1
waters	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
their	1
backs	1
as	1
they	1
scooped	1
out	1
huge	1

pieces	1
of	1

the	1

of	1
a	1

this	1
particular	1
feat	1
of	1
the	1
shark	1
seems	1
all	1
but	1
miraculous	1
how	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
apparently	1
unassailable	1
surface	1
they	1
contrive	1
to	1
gouge	1
out	1
such	1
symmetrical	1
mouthfuls	1

part	1
of	1
the	1
universal	1
problem	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
the	1
mark	1
they	1
thus	1
leave	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
may	1
best	1
be	1
likened	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
carpenter	1
in	1
countersinking	1
for	1
a	1
screw	1
	1
though	1
amid	1
all	1
the	1
smoking	1
horror	1
and	1
diabolism	1
of	1
a	1
sea	1
fight	1
sharks	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
longingly	1
gazing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
decks	1
like	1
hungry	1
dogs	1
round	1
a	1
table	1
where	1
red	1
meat	1
is	1
being	1
carved	1
ready	1
to	1
bolt	1
down	1
every	1
killed	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
tossed	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
though	1
while	1
the	1
valiant	1
butchers	1
over	1
the	1
deck	1
table	1
are	1
thus	1
cannibally	1
carving	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
live	1
meat	1
with	1
carving	1
knives	1
all	1
gilded	1
and	1
tasselled	1
the	1
sharks	1
also	1
with	1
their	1
jewel	1
hilted	1
mouths	1
are	1
quarrelsomely	1
carving	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
meat	1
and	1
though	1
were	1
you	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
upside	1
down	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
shocking	1
sharkish	1
business	1
enough	1
for	1
all	1
parties	1
and	1
though	1
sharks	1
also	1
are	1
the	1
invariable	1
outriders	1
of	1
all	1
slave	1
ships	1
crossing	1
the	1
atlantic	1
systematically	1
trotting	1
alongside	1
to	1
be	1
handy	1
in	1

a	1

to	1
be	1
carried	1
anywhere	1

a	1
dead	1

decently	1
buried	1
and	1
though	1
one	1

two	1
other	1

instances	1
might	1
be	1
set	1
down	1
touching	1
the	1
set	1
terms	1

and	1
occasions	1
when	1
sharks	1
do	1
most	1
socially	1
congregate	1
and	1
most	1
hilariously	1
feast	1
yet	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
conceivable	1
time	1
or	1
occasion	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
in	1
such	1
countless	1
numbers	1
and	1
in	1
gayer	1
or	1
more	1
jovial	1
spirits	1
than	1
around	1
a	1
dead	1
sperm	1

to	1
a	1
whaleship	1
at	1

the	1
whale	1
as	1
a	1
dish	1
	1
	1
that	1
mortal	1
man	1
should	1
feed	1
upon	1
the	1

that	1

as	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
this	1
seems	1
so	1
outlandish	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
into	1
the	1
history	1
and	1
philosophy	1
of	1
it	1
	1
it	1
is	1
upon	1
record	1
that	1
three	1
centuries	1
ago	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
was	1
esteemed	1
a	1
great	1
delicacy	1
in	1
france	1
and	1
commanded	1
large	1
prices	1
there	1
also	1
that	1
in	1
henry	1
viiith	1
s	1
time	1
a	1
certain	1
cook	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
obtained	1
a	1
handsome	1
reward	1
for	1
inventing	1
an	1
admirable	1
sauce	1
to	1
be	1
eaten	1
with	1
barbacued	1
porpoises	1
which	1
you	1
remember	1
are	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
whale	1
porpoises	1
indeed	1
are	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
considered	1
fine	1
eating	1
the	1
meat	1
is	1
made	1
into	1
balls	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
billiard	1
balls	1
and	1
being	1
well	1
seasoned	1
and	1
spiced	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
turtle	1
balls	1
or	1
veal	1
balls	1
the	1
old	1
monks	1
of	1
dunfermline	1
were	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
porpoise	1
grant	1
from	1
the	1
crown	1
	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
among	1
his	1
hunters	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
whale	1
would	1
by	1
all	1
hands	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
noble	1
dish	1
were	1
there	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
before	1
a	1
meat	1
pie	1
nearly	1
one	1
hundred	1
feet	1
long	1
it	1
takes	1
away	1
your	1
appetite	1
only	1
the	1
most	1
unprejudiced	1
of	1
men	1
like	1
stubb	1
nowadays	1
partake	1
of	1
cooked	1
whales	1
but	1
the	1
esquimaux	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
fastidious	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
how	1
they	1
live	1
upon	1
whales	1
and	1
have	1
rare	1
old	1
vintages	1
of	1
prime	1
old	1
train	1
oil	1
zogranda	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
most	1
famous	1
doctors	1
recommends	1
strips	1
of	1
blubber	1
for	1
infants	1
as	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
juicy	1
and	1
nourishing	1
and	1
this	1
reminds	1
me	1
that	1
certain	1
englishmen	1
who	1
long	1
ago	1
were	1
accidentally	1
left	1
in	1
greenland	1
by	1
a	1
whaling	1
vessel	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
actually	1
lived	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
on	1
the	1
mouldy	1
scraps	1
of	1
whales	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
ashore	1
after	1
trying	1
out	1
the	1
blubber	1
among	1
the	1
dutch	1
whalemen	1
these	1
scraps	1
are	1
called	1
fritters	1
which	1
indeed	1
they	1
greatly	1
resemble	1
being	1
brown	1
and	1
crisp	1
and	1
smelling	1
something	1
like	1
old	1
amsterdam	1
housewives	1
dough	1
nuts	1
or	1
oly	1
cooks	1
when	1
fresh	1
they	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
eatable	1
look	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
self	1
denying	1
stranger	1
can	1
hardly	1
keep	1
his	1
hands	1
off	1
	1
but	1
what	1
further	1
depreciates	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
a	1
civilized	1
dish	1
is	1
his	1
exceeding	1
richness	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
prize	1
ox	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
too	1
fat	1
to	1
be	1
delicately	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
hump	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
fine	1
eating	1
as	1
the	1
buffalo	1
s	1
which	1
is	1
esteemed	1
a	1
rare	1
dish	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
solid	1
pyramid	1
of	1
fat	1
but	1
the	1
spermaceti	1
itself	1
how	1
bland	1
and	1
creamy	1
that	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
transparent	1
half	1
jellied	1
white	1
meat	1
of	1
a	1
cocoanut	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
of	1
its	1
growth	1
yet	1
far	1
too	1
rich	1
to	1
supply	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
butter	1
nevertheless	1
many	1
whalemen	1
have	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
absorbing	1
it	1
into	1
some	1
other	1
substance	1
and	1
then	1
partaking	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
try	1
watches	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
dip	1
their	1
ship	1
biscuit	1
into	1
the	1
huge	1
oil	1
pots	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fry	1
there	1
awhile	1
many	1
a	1
good	1
supper	1
have	1
i	1
thus	1
made	1
	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
sperm	1
whale	1
the	1
brains	1
are	1
accounted	1
a	1
fine	1
dish	1
the	1
casket	1
of	1
the	1
skull	1
is	1
broken	1
into	1
with	1
an	1
axe	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
plump	1
whitish	1
lobes	1
being	1
withdrawn	1
precisely	1
resembling	1
two	1
large	1
puddings	1
they	1
are	1
then	1
mixed	1
with	1
flour	1
and	1
cooked	1
into	1
a	1
most	1
delectable	1
mess	1
in	1
flavor	1
somewhat	1
resembling	1
calves	1
head	1
which	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
dish	1
among	1
some	1
epicures	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
some	1
young	1
bucks	1
among	1
the	1
epicures	1

continually	1
dining	1
upon	1

a	1
little	1

	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
perhaps	1
entirely	1
because	1
the	1

so	1

to	1

the	1

	1
i	1
have	1
given	1
no	1
small	1
attention	1
to	1
that	1
not	1
unvexed	1
subject	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1

i	1
have	1
had	1
controversies	1
about	1
it	1
with	1
experienced	1
whalemen	1
afloat	1
and	1
learned	1
naturalists	1
ashore	1
my	1
original	1
opinion	1
remains	1
unchanged	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
opinion	1
	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
what	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
already	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
his	1
blubber	1
is	1
that	1
blubber	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
consistence	1
of	1
firm	1
close	1
grained	1
beef	1
but	1
tougher	1
more	1
elastic	1
and	1
compact	1
and	1
ranges	1
from	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
to	1
twelve	1
and	1
fifteen	1
inches	1
in	1
thickness	1
	1
now	1
however	1
preposterous	1
it	1
may	1
at	1
first	1
seem	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
any	1
creature	1
s	1
skin	1
as	1
being	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
consistence	1
and	1
thickness	1
yet	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
fact	1
these	1
are	1
no	1
arguments	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
presumption	1
because	1
you	1
cannot	1
raise	1
any	1
other	1
dense	1
enveloping	1
layer	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
body	1
but	1
that	1
same	1
blubber	1
and	1
the	1
outermost	1
enveloping	1
layer	1
of	1
any	1
animal	1
if	1
reasonably	1
dense	1
what	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
but	1
the	1
skin	1
true	1
from	1
the	1
unmarred	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
you	1
may	1
scrape	1
off	1
with	1
your	1
hand	1
an	1
infinitely	1
thin	1
transparent	1
substance	1
somewhat	1
resembling	1
the	1
thinnest	1
shreds	1
of	1
isinglass	1
only	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
as	1
flexible	1
and	1
soft	1
as	1
satin	1
that	1
is	1
previous	1
to	1
being	1
dried	1
when	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
contracts	1
and	1
thickens	1
but	1
becomes	1
rather	1
hard	1
and	1
brittle	1
i	1
have	1
several	1
such	1
dried	1
bits	1
which	1
i	1
use	1
for	1
marks	1
in	1
my	1
whale	1
books	1
it	1
is	1
transparent	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
before	1
and	1
being	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
printed	1
page	1
i	1
have	1
sometimes	1
pleased	1
myself	1
with	1
fancying	1
it	1
exerted	1
a	1
magnifying	1
influence	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
read	1
about	1
whales	1
through	1
their	1
own	1
spectacles	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
but	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
driving	1
at	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
same	1
infinitely	1
thin	1
isinglass	1
substance	1
which	1
i	1
admit	1
invests	1
the	1
entire	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
as	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
simply	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
proper	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
whale	1
is	1
thinner	1
and	1
more	1
tender	1
than	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
born	1
child	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
	1
assuming	1
the	1
blubber	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
then	1
when	1
this	1
skin	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
sperm	1
whale	1
will	1
yield	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
barrels	1
of	1
oil	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
that	1
in	1
quantity	1
or	1
rather	1
weight	1
that	1
oil	1
in	1
its	1
expressed	1
state	1
is	1
only	1
three	1
fourths	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
entire	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
some	1
idea	1
may	1
hence	1
be	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
enormousness	1
of	1
that	1
animated	1
mass	1
a	1
mere	1
part	1
of	1
whose	1
mere	1
integument	1
yields	1
such	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
liquid	1
as	1
that	1
reckoning	1
ten	1
barrels	1
to	1
the	1
ton	1
you	1
have	1
ten	1
tons	1
for	1
the	1
net	1
weight	1
of	1
only	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
stuff	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
skin	1
	1
in	1
life	1
the	1
visible	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
marvels	1
he	1
presents	1
almost	1
invariably	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
obliquely	1
crossed	1
and	1
re	1
crossed	1
with	1
numberless	1
straight	1
marks	1
in	1
thick	1
array	1
something	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
finest	1
italian	1
line	1
engravings	1
but	1
these	1
marks	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
impressed	1
upon	1
the	1
isinglass	1
substance	1
above	1
mentioned	1
but	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
engraved	1
upon	1
the	1
body	1
itself	1
nor	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
observant	1
eye	1
those	1
linear	1
marks	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
veritable	1
engraving	1
but	1
afford	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
far	1
other	1
delineations	1
these	1
are	1
hieroglyphical	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
you	1
call	1
those	1
mysterious	1
cyphers	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
pyramids	1
hieroglyphics	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
proper	1
word	1
to	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
connexion	1
by	1
my	1
retentive	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
hieroglyphics	1
upon	1
one	1
sperm	1
whale	1
in	1
particular	1
i	1
was	1
much	1
struck	1
with	1
a	1
plate	1
representing	1
the	1
old	1
indian	1
characters	1
chiselled	1
on	1
the	1
famous	1
hieroglyphic	1
palisades	1
on	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
mississippi	1
like	1
those	1
mystic	1
rocks	1
too	1
the	1
mystic	1
marked	1
whale	1
remains	1
undecipherable	1
this	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
indian	1
rocks	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
another	1
thing	1
besides	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
phenomena	1
which	1
the	1
exterior	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
presents	1
he	1
not	1
seldom	1
displays	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
his	1
flanks	1
effaced	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
regular	1
linear	1
appearance	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
numerous	1
rude	1
scratches	1
altogether	1
of	1
an	1
irregular	1
random	1
aspect	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
new	1
england	1
rocks	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
which	1
agassiz	1
imagines	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
violent	1
scraping	1
contact	1
with	1
vast	1
floating	1
icebergs	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
rocks	1
must	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
resemble	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
it	1
also	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
such	1
scratches	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
are	1
probably	1
made	1
by	1
hostile	1
contact	1
with	1
other	1
whales	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
most	1
remarked	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
full	1
grown	1
bulls	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
two	1
more	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
or	1
blubber	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
stript	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
long	1
pieces	1
called	1
blanket	1
pieces	1
like	1
most	1
sea	1
terms	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
significant	1
for	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
indeed	1
wrapt	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
blubber	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
blanket	1
or	1
counterpane	1
or	1
still	1
better	1
an	1
indian	1
poncho	1
slipt	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
skirting	1
his	1
extremity	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
cosy	1
blanketing	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
enabled	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
comfortable	1
in	1
all	1
weathers	1
in	1
all	1
seas	1
times	1
and	1
tides	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
a	1
greenland	1
whale	1
say	1
in	1
those	1
shuddering	1
icy	1
seas	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
if	1
unsupplied	1
with	1
his	1
cosy	1
surtout	1
true	1
other	1
fish	1
are	1
found	1
exceedingly	1
brisk	1
in	1
those	1
hyperborean	1
waters	1
but	1
these	1
be	1
it	1
observed	1
are	1
your	1
cold	1
blooded	1
lungless	1
fish	1
whose	1
very	1
bellies	1
are	1
refrigerators	1
creatures	1
that	1
warm	1
themselves	1
under	1
the	1
lee	1
of	1
an	1
iceberg	1
as	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
winter	1
would	1
bask	1
before	1
an	1
inn	1
fire	1
whereas	1
like	1
man	1
the	1

has	1
lungs	1
and	1
warm	1
blood	1
freeze	1
his	1
blood	1
and	1
he	1
dies	1
how	1
wonderful	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
except	1
after	1
explanation	1
that	1
this	1
great	1
monster	1
to	1
whom	1
corporeal	1
warmth	1
is	1
as	1
indispensable	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1

how	1

should	1

at	1

more	1
surprising	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
has	1
been	1

that	1
the	1

of	1

whale	1
is	1
warmer	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
borneo	1

	1
it	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
herein	1
we	1

the	1
rare	1
virtue	1
of	1
a	1

it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1

to	1
a	1

told	1
of	1
the	1

man	1
among	1

what	1
was	1

seemed	1
that	1
the	1

in	1
question	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
wonderful	1
ascendency	1
over	1
almost	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
jeroboam	1
his	1
story	1
was	1
this	1
	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
originally	1
nurtured	1
among	1
the	1
crazy	1
society	1
of	1
neskyeuna	1
shakers	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
in	1
their	1
cracked	1
secret	1
meetings	1
having	1
several	1
times	1
descended	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
trap	1
door	1
announcing	1
the	1
speedy	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
vial	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
in	1
his	1
vest	1
pocket	1
but	1
which	1
instead	1
of	1
containing	1
gunpowder	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
laudanum	1
a	1
strange	1
apostolic	1
whim	1
having	1
seized	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
neskyeuna	1
for	1
nantucket	1
where	1
with	1
that	1
cunning	1
peculiar	1
to	1
craziness	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
steady	1
common	1
sense	1
exterior	1
and	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
green	1
hand	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
jeroboam	1
s	1
whaling	1
voyage	1
they	1
engaged	1
him	1
but	1
straightway	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land	1
his	1
insanity	1
broke	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
freshet	1
he	1
announced	1
himself	1
as	1
the	1
archangel	1
gabriel	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
captain	1
to	1
jump	1
overboard	1
he	1
published	1
his	1
manifesto	1
whereby	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
deliverer	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
vicar	1
general	1
of	1
all	1
oceanica	1
the	1
unflinching	1
earnestness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
declared	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
dark	1
daring	1
play	1
of	1
his	1
sleepless	1
excited	1
imagination	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
preternatural	1
terrors	1
of	1
real	1
delirium	1
united	1
to	1
invest	1
this	1
gabriel	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
ignorant	1
crew	1
with	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
sacredness	1
moreover	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
much	1
practical	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
work	1
except	1
when	1
he	1
pleased	1
the	1
incredulous	1
captain	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
been	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
apprised	1
that	1
that	1
individual	1
s	1
intention	1
was	1
to	1
land	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
convenient	1
port	1
the	1
archangel	1
forthwith	1
opened	1
all	1
his	1
seals	1
and	1
vials	1
devoting	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
unconditional	1
perdition	1
in	1
case	1
this	1
intention	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
so	1
strongly	1
did	1
he	1
work	1
upon	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
the	1
crew	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
if	1
gabriel	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
remain	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
forced	1
to	1
relinquish	1
his	1
plan	1
nor	1
would	1
they	1
permit	1
gabriel	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
way	1
maltreated	1
say	1
or	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
gabriel	1
had	1
the	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
archangel	1
cared	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
mates	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
epidemic	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
higher	1
hand	1
than	1
ever	1
declaring	1
that	1
the	1
plague	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
sole	1
command	1
nor	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
stayed	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
the	1
sailors	1
mostly	1
poor	1
devils	1
cringed	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
fawned	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
his	1
instructions	1
sometimes	1
rendering	1
him	1
personal	1
homage	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
god	1
such	1
things	1
may	1
seem	1
incredible	1
but	1
however	1
wondrous	1
they	1
are	1
true	1
nor	1
is	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
fanatics	1
half	1
so	1
striking	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
measureless	1
self	1
deception	1
of	1
the	1
fanatic	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
measureless	1
power	1
of	1
deceiving	1
and	1
bedevilling	1
so	1
many	1
others	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
pequod	1
	1
i	1
fear	1
not	1
thy	1
epidemic	1
man	1
said	1
ahab	1
from	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
to	1
captain	1
mayhew	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
stern	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
	1
but	1
now	1
gabriel	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
	1
think	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
fevers	1
yellow	1
and	1
bilious	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
plague	1
	1
gabriel	1
gabriel	1
cried	1
captain	1
mayhew	1
thou	1
must	1
either	1
but	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
headlong	1
wave	1
shot	1
the	1
boat	1
far	1
ahead	1
and	1
its	1
seethings	1
drowned	1
all	1
speech	1
	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
demanded	1
ahab	1
when	1
the	1
boat	1
drifted	1
back	1
	1
think	1
think	1
of	1
thy	1
whale	1
boat	1
stoven	1
and	1
sunk	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
horrible	1
tail	1
	1
i	1
tell	1
thee	1
again	1
gabriel	1
that	1
but	1
again	1
the	1
boat	1
tore	1
ahead	1
as	1
if	1
dragged	1
by	1
fiends	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
while	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
riotous	1
waves	1
rolled	1
by	1
which	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
occasional	1
caprices	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
were	1
tumbling	1
not	1
heaving	1
it	1
meantime	1
the	1
hoisted	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
jogged	1
about	1
very	1
violently	1
and	1
gabriel	1
was	1
seen	1
eyeing	1
it	1
with	1
rather	1
more	1
apprehensiveness	1
than	1
his	1
archangel	1
nature	1
seemed	1
to	1
warrant	1
	1
when	1
this	1
interlude	1
was	1
over	1
captain	1
mayhew	1
began	1
a	1
dark	1
story	1
concerning	1
moby	1
dick	1
not	1
however	1
without	1
frequent	1
interruptions	1
from	1
gabriel	1
whenever	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
mentioned	1
and	1
the	1
crazy	1
sea	1
that	1
seemed	1
leagued	1
with	1
him	1
	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
jeroboam	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
left	1
home	1
when	1
upon	1
speaking	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
her	1
people	1
were	1
reliably	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
moby	1
dick	1
and	1
the	1
havoc	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
greedily	1
sucking	1
in	1
this	1
intelligence	1
gabriel	1
solemnly	1
warned	1
the	1
captain	1
against	1
attacking	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
monster	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
gibbering	1
insanity	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
being	1
than	1
the	1
shaker	1
god	1
incarnated	1
the	1
shakers	1
receiving	1
the	1
bible	1
but	1
when	1
some	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
afterwards	1
moby	1
dick	1
was	1
fairly	1
sighted	1
from	1
the	1
mast	1
heads	1
macey	1
the	1
chief	1
mate	1
burned	1
with	1
ardour	1
to	1
encounter	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
himself	1
being	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
despite	1
all	1
the	1
archangel	1
s	1
denunciations	1
and	1
forewarnings	1
macey	1
succeeded	1
in	1
persuading	1
five	1
men	1
to	1
man	1
his	1
boat	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
pushed	1
off	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
weary	1
pulling	1
and	1
many	1
perilous	1
unsuccessful	1
onsets	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
one	1
iron	1
fast	1
meantime	1
gabriel	1
ascending	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
royal	1
mast	1
head	1
was	1
tossing	1
one	1
arm	1
in	1
frantic	1
gestures	1
and	1
hurling	1
forth	1
prophecies	1
of	1
speedy	1
doom	1
to	1
the	1
sacrilegious	1
assailants	1
of	1
his	1
divinity	1
now	1
while	1
macey	1
the	1
mate	1
was	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
s	1
bow	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
reckless	1
energy	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
was	1
venting	1
his	1
wild	1
exclamations	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
essaying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
fair	1
chance	1
for	1
his	1
poised	1
lance	1
lo	1
a	1
broad	1
white	1
shadow	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
its	1
quick	1
fanning	1
motion	1
temporarily	1
taking	1
the	1
breath	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
next	1
instant	1
the	1
luckless	1
mate	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
furious	1
life	1
was	1
smitten	1
bodily	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
long	1
arc	1
in	1
his	1
descent	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
about	1
fifty	1
yards	1
not	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
harmed	1
nor	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
any	1
oarsman	1
s	1
head	1
but	1
the	1
mate	1
for	1
ever	1
sank	1
	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
to	1
parenthesize	1
here	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fatal	1
accidents	1
in	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
fishery	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
perhaps	1
almost	1
as	1
frequent	1
as	1
any	1
sometimes	1
nothing	1
is	1
injured	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
thus	1
annihilated	1
oftener	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
bow	1
is	1
knocked	1
off	1
or	1
the	1
thigh	1
board	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
headsman	1
stands	1
is	1
torn	1
from	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
accompanies	1
the	1
body	1
but	1
strangest	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
in	1
more	1
instances	1
than	1
one	1
when	1
the	1
body	1
has	1
been	1
recovered	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
mark	1
of	1
violence	1
is	1
discernible	1
the	1
man	1
being	1
stark	1
dead	1
	1
the	1
whole	1
calamity	1
with	1
the	1
falling	1
form	1
of	1
macey	1
was	1
plainly	1
descried	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
raising	1
a	1
piercing	1
shriek	1
the	1
vial	1
the	1
vial	1
gabriel	1
called	1
off	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
crew	1
from	1
the	1
further	1
hunting	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
this	1
terrible	1
event	1
clothed	1
the	1
archangel	1
with	1
added	1
influence	1
because	1
his	1
credulous	1
disciples	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
specifically	1
fore	1
announced	1
it	1
instead	1
of	1
only	1
making	1
a	1
general	1
prophecy	1
which	1
any	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
chanced	1
to	1
hit	1
one	1
of	1
many	1
marks	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
margin	1
allowed	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
nameless	1
terror	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
	1
mayhew	1
having	1
concluded	1
his	1
narration	1
ahab	1
put	1
such	1
questions	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
stranger	1
captain	1
could	1
not	1
forbear	1
inquiring	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
hunt	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
if	1
opportunity	1
should	1
offer	1
to	1
which	1
ahab	1
answered	1
aye	1
straightway	1
then	1
gabriel	1
once	1
more	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
glaring	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
vehemently	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
downward	1
pointed	1
finger	1
think	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
blasphemer	1
dead	1
and	1
down	1
there	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
blasphemer	1
s	1
end	1
	1
ahab	1
stolidly	1
turned	1
aside	1
then	1
said	1
to	1
mayhew	1
captain	1
i	1
have	1
just	1
bethought	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
letter	1
bag	1

is	1
a	1

	1
every	1
whale	1
ship	1
takes	1
out	1
a	1
goodly	1
number	1
of	1
letters	1
for	1
various	1
ships	1
whose	1
delivery	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
may	1
be	1

depends	1
upon	1
the	1
mere	1
chance	1
of	1
encountering	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
oceans	1
thus	1
most	1
letters	1
never	1
reach	1
their	1
mark	1
and	1
many	1
are	1
only	1

after	1
attaining	1
an	1
age	1
of	1
two	1

three	1
years	1

flounders	1
about	1
half	1
on	1

half	1
in	1
the	1

figured	1
in	1

in	1
which	1
to	1
my	1
eyes	1
at	1

he	1
appeared	1
to	1
uncommon	1
advantage	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
better	1
chance	1
to	1
observe	1
him	1
as	1
will	1
presently	1

was	1
my	1

upon	1

while	1
taking	1
that	1
hard	1
scrabble	1
scramble	1
upon	1
the	1
dead	1
whale	1
s	1
back	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
italian	1
organ	1
boys	1
holding	1
a	1
dancing	1
ape	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
cord	1
just	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
steep	1
side	1
did	1
i	1
hold	1
queequeg	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
technically	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
a	1
monkey	1
rope	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
strong	1
strip	1
of	1
canvas	1
belted	1
round	1
his	1
waist	1
	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
humorously	1
perilous	1
business	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
for	1
before	1
we	1
proceed	1
further	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
monkey	1
rope	1
was	1
fast	1
at	1
both	1
ends	1
fast	1
to	1
queequeg	1
s	1
broad	1
canvas	1
belt	1
and	1
fast	1
to	1
my	1
narrow	1
leather	1
one	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
better	1
or	1
for	1
worse	1
we	1
two	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
were	1
wedded	1
and	1
should	1
poor	1
queequeg	1
sink	1
to	1
rise	1
no	1
more	1
then	1
both	1
usage	1
and	1
honour	1
demanded	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
cutting	1
the	1
cord	1
it	1
should	1
drag	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
wake	1
so	1
then	1
an	1
elongated	1
siamese	1
ligature	1
united	1
us	1
queequeg	1
was	1
my	1
own	1
inseparable	1
twin	1
brother	1
nor	1
could	1
i	1
any	1
way	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
dangerous	1
liabilities	1
which	1
the	1
hempen	1
bond	1
entailed	1
	1
so	1
strongly	1
and	1
metaphysically	1
did	1
i	1
conceive	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
then	1
that	1
while	1
earnestly	1
watching	1
his	1
motions	1
i	1
seemed	1
distinctly	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
individuality	1
was	1
now	1
merged	1
in	1
a	1
joint	1
stock	1
company	1
of	1
two	1
that	1
my	1
free	1
will	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
mortal	1
wound	1
and	1
that	1
another	1
s	1
mistake	1
or	1
misfortune	1
might	1
plunge	1
innocent	1
me	1
into	1
unmerited	1
disaster	1
and	1
death	1
therefore	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
interregnum	1
in	1
providence	1
for	1
its	1
even	1
handed	1
equity	1
never	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
gross	1
an	1
injustice	1
and	1
yet	1
still	1
further	1
pondering	1
while	1
i	1
jerked	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
ship	1
which	1
would	1
threaten	1
to	1
jam	1
him	1
still	1
further	1
pondering	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
situation	1
of	1
mine	1
was	1
the	1
precise	1
situation	1
of	1
every	1
mortal	1
that	1
breathes	1
only	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
he	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
has	1
this	1
siamese	1
connexion	1
with	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
other	1
mortals	1
if	1
your	1
banker	1
breaks	1
you	1
snap	1
if	1
your	1
apothecary	1
by	1
mistake	1
sends	1
you	1
poison	1
in	1
your	1
pills	1
you	1
die	1
true	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
by	1
exceeding	1
caution	1
you	1
may	1
possibly	1
escape	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
multitudinous	1
other	1
evil	1
chances	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
handle	1
queequeg	1
s	1
monkey	1
rope	1
heedfully	1
as	1
i	1
would	1
sometimes	1
he	1
jerked	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
came	1
very	1
near	1
sliding	1
overboard	1
nor	1
could	1
i	1
possibly	1
forget	1
that	1
do	1
what	1
i	1
would	1
i	1
only	1
had	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
	1
	1
the	1
monkey	1
rope	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
all	1
whalers	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
pequod	1
that	1
the	1
monkey	1
and	1
his	1
holder	1
were	1
ever	1
tied	1
together	1
this	1
improvement	1
upon	1
the	1
original	1
usage	1
was	1
introduced	1
by	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
stubb	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
afford	1
the	1
imperilled	1
harpooneer	1
the	1
strongest	1
possible	1
guarantee	1
for	1
the	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
vigilance	1
of	1
his	1
monkey	1
rope	1
holder	1
	1
	1
i	1
have	1
hinted	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
often	1
jerk	1
poor	1
queequeg	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
ship	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
occasionally	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
incessant	1
rolling	1
and	1
swaying	1
of	1
both	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
jamming	1
jeopardy	1
he	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
unappalled	1
by	1
the	1
massacre	1
made	1
upon	1
them	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
sharks	1
now	1
freshly	1
and	1
more	1
keenly	1
allured	1
by	1
the	1
before	1
pent	1
blood	1
which	1
began	1
to	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
carcass	1
the	1
rabid	1
creatures	1
swarmed	1
round	1
it	1
like	1
bees	1
in	1
a	1
beehive	1
	1
and	1
right	1
in	1
among	1
those	1
sharks	1
was	1
queequeg	1
who	1
often	1
pushed	1
them	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
floundering	1
feet	1
a	1
thing	1
altogether	1
incredible	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
attracted	1
by	1
such	1
prey	1
as	1
a	1
dead	1
whale	1
the	1
otherwise	1
miscellaneously	1
carnivorous	1
shark	1
will	1
seldom	1
touch	1
a	1
man	1
	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
believed	1
that	1
since	1
they	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
ravenous	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
pie	1
it	1
is	1
deemed	1
but	1
wise	1
to	1
look	1
sharp	1
to	1
them	1
accordingly	1
besides	1
the	1
monkey	1
rope	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
jerked	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
from	1
too	1
close	1
a	1
vicinity	1
to	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
what	1
seemed	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
ferocious	1
shark	1
he	1
was	1
provided	1
with	1
still	1
another	1
protection	1
suspended	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stages	1
tashtego	1
and	1
daggoo	1
continually	1
flourished	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
keen	1
whale	1
spades	1
wherewith	1
they	1
slaughtered	1
as	1
many	1
sharks	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
reach	1
this	1
procedure	1
of	1
theirs	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1

very	1
disinterested	1
and	1
benevolent	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
meant	1
queequeg	1
s	1
best	1
happiness	1
i	1
admit	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
hasty	1
zeal	1
to	1
befriend	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
sharks	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
half	1
hidden	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
muddled	1
water	1
those	1
indiscreet	1
spades	1
of	1
theirs	1
would	1
come	1
nearer	1
amputating	1
a	1
leg	1
than	1
a	1
tail	1
but	1
poor	1
queequeg	1

straining	1

gasping	1
there	1
with	1
that	1
great	1
iron	1

then	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
over	1
him	1
	1
	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
borne	1
in	1

that	1
all	1
this	1

we	1
have	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
prodigious	1
head	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
side	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
let	1
it	1
continue	1
hanging	1
there	1
a	1
while	1
till	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
the	1

matters	1

and	1
the	1
best	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
to	1
pray	1
heaven	1
the	1
tackles	1
may	1
hold	1
	1
now	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
night	1
and	1
forenoon	1
the	1
pequod	1
had	1
gradually	1
drifted	1
into	1
a	1
sea	1
which	1
by	1
its	1
occasional	1
patches	1
of	1
yellow	1
brit	1
gave	1
unusual	1
tokens	1
of	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
right	1
whales	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
that	1
but	1
few	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
this	1
particular	1
time	1
lurking	1
anywhere	1
near	1
and	1
though	1
all	1
hands	1
commonly	1
disdained	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
those	1
inferior	1
creatures	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
pequod	1
was	1
not	1
commissioned	1
to	1
cruise	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
numbers	1
of	1
them	1
near	1
the	1
crozetts	1
without	1
lowering	1
a	1
boat	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
alongside	1
and	1
beheaded	1
to	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
announcement	1
was	1
made	1
that	1
a	1
right	1
whale	1
should	1
be	1
captured	1
that	1
day	1
if	1
opportunity	1
offered	1
	1
nor	1
was	1
this	1
long	1
wanting	1
tall	1
spouts	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
leeward	1
and	1
two	1
boats	1
stubb	1
s	1
and	1
flask	1
s	1
were	1
detached	1
in	1
pursuit	1
pulling	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
away	1
they	1
at	1
last	1
became	1
almost	1
invisible	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
mast	1
head	1
but	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
white	1
water	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
news	1
came	1
from	1
aloft	1
that	1
one	1
or	1
both	1
the	1
boats	1
must	1
be	1
fast	1
an	1
interval	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
in	1
plain	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
being	1
dragged	1
right	1
towards	1
the	1
ship	1
by	1
the	1
towing	1
whale	1
so	1
close	1
did	1
the	1
monster	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hull	1
that	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
meant	1
it	1
malice	1
but	1
suddenly	1
going	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
maelstrom	1
within	1
three	1
rods	1
of	1
the	1
planks	1
he	1
wholly	1
disappeared	1
from	1
view	1
as	1
if	1
diving	1
under	1
the	1
keel	1
cut	1
cut	1
was	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
the	1
boats	1
which	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
seemed	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
brought	1
with	1
a	1
deadly	1
dash	1
against	1
the	1
vessel	1
s	1
side	1
but	1
having	1
plenty	1
of	1
line	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
tubs	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
not	1
sounding	1
very	1
rapidly	1
they	1
paid	1
out	1
abundance	1
of	1
rope	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
pulled	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
might	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
struggle	1
was	1
intensely	1
critical	1
for	1
while	1
they	1
still	1
slacked	1
out	1
the	1
tightened	1
line	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
and	1
still	1
plied	1
their	1
oars	1
in	1
another	1
the	1
contending	1
strain	1
threatened	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
under	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
advance	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
gain	1
and	1
they	1
stuck	1
to	1
it	1
till	1
they	1
did	1
gain	1
it	1
when	1
instantly	1
a	1
swift	1
tremor	1
was	1
felt	1
running	1
like	1
lightning	1
along	1
the	1
keel	1
as	1
the	1
strained	1
line	1
scraping	1
beneath	1
the	1
ship	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
to	1
view	1
under	1
her	1
bows	1
snapping	1
and	1
quivering	1
and	1
so	1
flinging	1
off	1
its	1
drippings	1
that	1
the	1
drops	1
fell	1
like	1
bits	1
of	1
broken	1
glass	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
while	1
the	1
whale	1
beyond	1
also	1
rose	1
to	1
sight	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
boats	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
fly	1
but	1
the	1
fagged	1
whale	1
abated	1
his	1
speed	1
and	1
blindly	1
altering	1
his	1
course	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
towing	1
the	1
two	1
boats	1
after	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
performed	1
a	1
complete	1
circuit	1
	1
meantime	1
they	1
hauled	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
upon	1
their	1
lines	1
till	1
close	1
flanking	1
him	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
stubb	1
answered	1
flask	1
with	1
lance	1
for	1
lance	1
and	1
thus	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
pequod	1
the	1
battle	1
went	1
while	1
the	1
multitudes	1
of	1
sharks	1
that	1
had	1
before	1
swum	1
round	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
body	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
fresh	1
blood	1
that	1
was	1
spilled	1
thirstily	1
drinking	1
at	1
every	1
new	1
gash	1
as	1
the	1
eager	1
israelites	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
bursting	1
fountains	1
that	1
poured	1
from	1
the	1
smitten	1
rock	1
	1
at	1
last	1
his	1
spout	1
grew	1
thick	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
frightful	1
roll	1
and	1
vomit	1
he	1
turned	1
upon	1
his	1
back	1
a	1
corpse	1
	1
while	1
the	1
two	1
headsmen	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
making	1
fast	1
cords	1
to	1
his	1
flukes	1
and	1
in	1
other	1
ways	1
getting	1
the	1
mass	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
towing	1
some	1
conversation	1
ensued	1
between	1
them	1
	1
i	1
wonder	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
wants	1
with	1
this	1
lump	1
of	1
foul	1
lard	1
said	1
stubb	1
not	1
without	1
some	1
disgust	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
so	1
ignoble	1
a	1
leviathan	1
	1
wants	1
with	1
it	1
said	1
flask	1
coiling	1
some	1
spare	1
line	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
bow	1
did	1
you	1
never	1
hear	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
which	1
but	1
once	1
has	1
a	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
hoisted	1
on	1
her	1
starboard	1
side	1
and	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
a	1
right	1
whale	1
s	1
on	1
the	1
larboard	1
did	1
you	1
never	1

that	1
that	1

never	1
afterwards	1
capsize	1
	1
why	1
not	1
	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

i	1
heard	1
that	1
gamboge	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
fedallah	1
saying	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
ships	1
charms	1
but	1
i	1
sometimes	1
think	1
he	1
ll	1
charm	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
half	1
like	1
that	1

you	1
ever	1
notice	1
how	1
that	1

of	1
carved	1
into	1
a	1
snake	1

if	1
ever	1
i	1
get	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
night	1

the	1

the	1

are	1
by	1

the	1

they	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
whales	1
regularly	1
hunted	1
by	1

present	1
the	1
two	1
extremes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
varieties	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
the	1
external	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
is	1
mainly	1
observable	1
in	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
each	1
is	1
this	1
moment	1
hanging	1
from	1

from	1

merely	1
stepping	1
across	1

you	1
obtain	1

better	1
chance	1
to	1

cetology	1
than	1
here	1
	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
you	1
are	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
general	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
heads	1
both	1
are	1
massive	1
enough	1
in	1
all	1
conscience	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
mathematical	1
symmetry	1
in	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
which	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
s	1
sadly	1
lacks	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
as	1
you	1
behold	1
it	1
you	1
involuntarily	1
yield	1
the	1
immense	1
superiority	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
pervading	1
dignity	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
too	1
this	1
dignity	1
is	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
pepper	1
and	1
salt	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
summit	1
giving	1
token	1
of	1
advanced	1
age	1
and	1
large	1
experience	1
in	1
short	1
he	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
fishermen	1
technically	1
call	1
a	1
grey	1
headed	1
whale	1
	1
let	1
us	1
now	1
note	1
what	1
is	1
least	1
dissimilar	1
in	1
these	1
heads	1
namely	1
the	1
two	1
most	1
important	1
organs	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
the	1
ear	1
far	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
low	1
down	1
near	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
either	1
whale	1
s	1
jaw	1
if	1
you	1
narrowly	1
search	1
you	1
will	1
at	1
last	1
see	1
a	1
lashless	1
eye	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
fancy	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
colt	1
s	1
eye	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
proportion	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
magnitude	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
	1
now	1
from	1
this	1
peculiar	1
sideway	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
eyes	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
never	1
see	1
an	1
object	1
which	1
is	1
exactly	1
ahead	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
one	1
exactly	1
astern	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
eyes	1
corresponds	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
ears	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
fancy	1
for	1
yourself	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
fare	1
with	1
you	1
did	1
you	1
sideways	1
survey	1
objects	1
through	1
your	1
ears	1
you	1
would	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
command	1
some	1
thirty	1
degrees	1
of	1
vision	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
straight	1
side	1
line	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
about	1
thirty	1
more	1
behind	1
it	1
if	1
your	1
bitterest	1
foe	1
were	1
walking	1
straight	1
towards	1
you	1
with	1
dagger	1
uplifted	1
in	1
broad	1
day	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
stealing	1
upon	1
you	1
from	1
behind	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
two	1
backs	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
also	1
two	1
fronts	1
side	1
fronts	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
what	1
indeed	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
	1
moreover	1
while	1
in	1
most	1
other	1
animals	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
now	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
are	1
so	1
planted	1
as	1
imperceptibly	1
to	1
blend	1
their	1
visual	1
power	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
produce	1
one	1
picture	1
and	1
not	1
two	1
to	1
the	1
brain	1
the	1
peculiar	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
eyes	1
effectually	1
divided	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
by	1
many	1
cubic	1
feet	1
of	1
solid	1
head	1
which	1
towers	1
between	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
separating	1
two	1
lakes	1
in	1
valleys	1

must	1
wholly	1
separate	1
the	1
impressions	1
which	1
each	1
independent	1
organ	1
imparts	1
the	1
whale	1
therefore	1
must	1
see	1
one	1
distinct	1
picture	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
another	1
distinct	1
picture	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
while	1
all	1
between	1
must	1
be	1
profound	1
darkness	1
and	1
nothingness	1
to	1
him	1
man	1
may	1
in	1
effect	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
a	1
sentry	1
box	1
with	1
two	1
joined	1
sashes	1
for	1
his	1
window	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
these	1
two	1
sashes	1
are	1
separately	1
inserted	1
making	1
two	1
distinct	1
windows	1
but	1
sadly	1
impairing	1
the	1
view	1
this	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
eyes	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
in	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
by	1
the	1
reader	1
in	1
some	1
subsequent	1
scenes	1
	1
a	1
curious	1
and	1
most	1
puzzling	1
question	1
might	1
be	1
started	1
concerning	1
this	1
visual	1
matter	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
leviathan	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
a	1
hint	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
seeing	1
is	1
involuntary	1
that	1
is	1
he	1
cannot	1
then	1
help	1
mechanically	1
seeing	1
whatever	1
objects	1
are	1
before	1
him	1
nevertheless	1
any	1
one	1
s	1
experience	1
will	1
teach	1
him	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
can	1
take	1
in	1
an	1
undiscriminating	1
sweep	1
of	1
things	1
at	1
one	1
glance	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
attentively	1
and	1
completely	1
to	1
examine	1
any	1
two	1
things	1
however	1
large	1
or	1
however	1
small	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
of	1
time	1
never	1
mind	1
if	1
they	1
lie	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
and	1
touch	1
each	1
other	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
separate	1
these	1
two	1
objects	1
and	1
surround	1
each	1
by	1
a	1
circle	1
of	1
profound	1
darkness	1
then	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
other	1
will	1
be	1
utterly	1
excluded	1
from	1
your	1
contemporary	1
consciousness	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
true	1
both	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
themselves	1
must	1
simultaneously	1
act	1
but	1
is	1
his	1
brain	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
comprehensive	1
combining	1
and	1
subtle	1
than	1
man	1
s	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
of	1
time	1
attentively	1
examine	1
two	1
distinct	1
prospects	1
one	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
exactly	1
opposite	1
direction	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
as	1
marvellous	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
were	1
able	1
simultaneously	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
two	1
distinct	1
problems	1
in	1
euclid	1
nor	1
strictly	1
investigated	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
incongruity	1
in	1
this	1
comparison	1
	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
an	1
idle	1
whim	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
vacillations	1
of	1
movement	1
displayed	1
by	1
some	1
whales	1
when	1
beset	1
by	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
boats	1
the	1
timidity	1
and	1
liability	1
to	1
queer	1
frights	1
so	1
common	1
to	1
such	1
whales	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
indirectly	1
proceeds	1
from	1
the	1
helpless	1
perplexity	1
of	1
volition	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
divided	1
and	1
diametrically	1
opposite	1
powers	1
of	1
vision	1
must	1
involve	1
them	1
	1
but	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
full	1
as	1
curious	1
as	1
the	1
eye	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
entire	1
stranger	1
to	1
their	1
race	1
you	1
might	1
hunt	1
over	1
these	1
two	1
heads	1
for	1
hours	1
and	1
never	1
discover	1
that	1
organ	1
the	1
ear	1
has	1
no	1
external	1
leaf	1
whatever	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hole	1
itself	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
insert	1
a	1
quill	1
so	1
wondrously	1
minute	1
is	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
lodged	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
eye	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
their	1
ears	1
this	1
important	1
difference	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
between	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
while	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
has	1
an	1
external	1
opening	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
entirely	1
and	1
evenly	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
membrane	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
imperceptible	1
from	1
without	1
	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
curious	1
that	1
so	1
vast	1
a	1
being	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
so	1
small	1
an	1
eye	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
thunder	1
through	1
an	1
ear	1
which	1
is	1
smaller	1
than	1
a	1
hare	1
s	1
but	1
if	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
broad	1
as	1
the	1
lens	1
of	1
herschel	1
s	1
great	1
telescope	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
capacious	1
as	1
the	1
porches	1
of	1
cathedrals	1
would	1
that	1
make	1
him	1
any	1
longer	1
of	1
sight	1
or	1
sharper	1
of	1
hearing	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
why	1
then	1
do	1
you	1
try	1
to	1
enlarge	1
your	1
mind	1
subtilize	1
it	1
	1
let	1
us	1
now	1
with	1
whatever	1
levers	1
and	1
steam	1
engines	1
we	1
have	1
at	1
hand	1
cant	1
over	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
lie	1
bottom	1
up	1
then	1
ascending	1
by	1
a	1
ladder	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
have	1
a	1
peep	1
down	1
the	1
mouth	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
now	1
completely	1
separated	1
from	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
lantern	1
we	1
might	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
kentucky	1
mammoth	1
cave	1
of	1
his	1
stomach	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
on	1
here	1
by	1
this	1
tooth	1
and	1
look	1
about	1
us	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
what	1
a	1
really	1
beautiful	1
and	1
chaste	1
looking	1
mouth	1
from	1
floor	1
to	1
ceiling	1
lined	1
or	1
rather	1
papered	1
with	1
a	1
glistening	1
white	1
membrane	1
glossy	1
as	1
bridal	1
satins	1
	1
but	1
come	1
out	1
now	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
portentous	1
lower	1
jaw	1
which	1
seems	1
like	1
the	1
long	1
narrow	1
lid	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
snuff	1
box	1
with	1
the	1
hinge	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
instead	1
of	1
one	1
side	1
if	1
you	1
pry	1
it	1
up	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
overhead	1
and	1
expose	1
its	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
terrific	1
portcullis	1
and	1
such	1
alas	1
it	1
proves	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
poor	1
wight	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
upon	1
whom	1
these	1
spikes	1
fall	1
with	1
impaling	1
force	1
but	1
far	1
more	1
terrible	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
behold	1
when	1
fathoms	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
you	1
see	1
some	1
sulky	1
whale	1
floating	1
there	1
suspended	1
with	1
his	1
prodigious	1
jaw	1
some	1
fifteen	1
feet	1
long	1
hanging	1
straight	1
down	1
at	1
right	1
angles	1
with	1
his	1
body	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
jib	1
boom	1
this	1
whale	1
is	1
not	1
dead	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
dispirited	1
out	1
of	1
sorts	1
perhaps	1
hypochondriac	1
and	1
so	1
supine	1
that	1
the	1
hinges	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
have	1
relaxed	1
leaving	1
him	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
ungainly	1
sort	1
of	1
plight	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
tribe	1
who	1
must	1
no	1
doubt	1
imprecate	1
lock	1
jaws	1
upon	1
him	1
	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
this	1
lower	1
jaw	1
being	1
easily	1
unhinged	1
by	1
a	1
practised	1

disengaged	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1

the	1
purpose	1
of	1
extracting	1
the	1
ivory	1
teeth	1
and	1
furnishing	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
that	1
hard	1
white	1

with	1
which	1
the	1

fashion	1
all	1

curious	1

to	1

	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
weary	1

the	1
jaw	1
is	1
dragged	1
on	1
board	1
as	1
if	1
it	1

	1
as	1
in	1
general	1
shape	1
the	1

s	1
head	1
may	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
roman	1
war	1
chariot	1

in	1
front	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
broadly	1

so	1
at	1
a	1
broad	1
view	1
the	1

s	1

bears	1
a	1
rather	1
inelegant	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
gigantic	1
galliot	1
toed	1
shoe	1
two	1
hundred	1
years	1
ago	1
an	1
old	1
dutch	1

that	1
of	1

in	1

of	1

very	1

	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
head	1
it	1
begins	1
to	1
assume	1
different	1
aspects	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
if	1
you	1
stand	1
on	1
its	1
summit	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
two	1
f	1
shaped	1
spoutholes	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
head	1
for	1
an	1
enormous	1
bass	1
viol	1
and	1
these	1
spiracles	1
the	1
apertures	1
in	1
its	1
sounding	1
board	1
then	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
fix	1
your	1

upon	1
this	1
strange	1
crested	1
comb	1
like	1
incrustation	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1

of	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
fixing	1
your	1

solely	1
on	1
this	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
the	1

for	1
the	1

of	1
some	1
huge	1
oak	1
with	1
a	1

that	1
nestle	1
here	1
on	1
this	1

such	1
an	1
idea	1
will	1
be	1
almost	1
sure	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
you	1
unless	1
indeed	1
your	1

has	1
been	1
fixed	1
by	1
the	1

bestowed	1
upon	1
it	1

you	1
will	1
take	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
thinking	1
how	1
this	1
mighty	1
monster	1
is	1
actually	1
a	1
diademed	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
whose	1
green	1
crown	1
has	1
been	1
put	1
together	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
marvellous	1
manner	1

if	1
this	1

be	1
a	1
king	1
he	1
is	1

mentioned	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
these	1

are	1
fringed	1
with	1
hairy	1
fibres	1
through	1
which	1
the	1

strains	1
the	1

in	1

retains	1

are	1
certain	1
curious	1
marks	1

some	1

calculate	1
the	1

age	1
as	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
an	1

the	1
certainty	1
of	1
this	1
criterion	1

far	1
from	1
demonstrable	1
yet	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
savor	1
of	1
analogical	1
probability	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
if	1
we	1
yield	1
to	1
it	1
we	1
must	1
grant	1
a	1
far	1
greater	1
age	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
than	1
at	1
first	1
glance	1
will	1
seem	1
reasonable	1
	1
in	1
old	1
times	1

seem	1
to	1
have	1
prevailed	1
the	1
most	1
curious	1
fancies	1
concerning	1
these	1

are	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1

fifty	1
fins	1
growing	1
on	1
each	1

of	1

arch	1
over	1
his	1
tongue	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
	1
	1
this	1
reminds	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
really	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
whisker	1
or	1
rather	1
a	1
moustache	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
scattered	1
white	1

on	1

part	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
end	1
of	1
the	1

impart	1
a	1
rather	1
brigandish	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1

you	1

furnish	1
to	1

and	1
other	1
stiffening	1
contrivances	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
the	1
demand	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
decline	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
queen	1
anne	1
s	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
bone	1
was	1
in	1
its	1
glory	1
the	1
farthingale	1
being	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
fashion	1
and	1
as	1
those	1
ancient	1
dames	1
moved	1
about	1
gaily	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
even	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
shower	1
with	1
the	1
like	1
thoughtlessness	1
do	1
we	1
nowadays	1
fly	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
jaws	1
for	1
protection	1
the	1
umbrella	1
being	1
a	1
tent	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1

bone	1
	1
but	1
now	1
forget	1
all	1
about	1
blinds	1
and	1
whiskers	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
s	1
mouth	1
look	1
around	1
you	1
afresh	1
seeing	1
all	1
these	1
colonnades	1
of	1
bone	1
so	1
methodically	1
ranged	1
about	1
would	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
haarlem	1

and	1
gazing	1
upon	1
its	1
thousand	1
pipes	1
for	1
a	1

to	1
the	1

we	1
have	1
a	1

of	1
the	1

which	1
is	1
glued	1
as	1
it	1

to	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

it	1
is	1
very	1
fat	1

tender	1
and	1
apt	1
to	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
in	1
hoisting	1
it	1
on	1
deck	1
this	1
particular	1
tongue	1
now	1
before	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
passing	1
glance	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
six	1

that	1
is	1
it	1
will	1
yield	1
you	1
about	1
that	1
amount	1
of	1
oil	1
	1
ere	1
this	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
plainly	1
seen	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
started	1
with	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
have	1
almost	1
entirely	1
different	1
heads	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
s	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
well	1
of	1

no	1
ivory	1

at	1

no	1

there	1
any	1

scarcely	1
anything	1

in	1
following	1
	1

you	1
catch	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1

s	1
there	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
died	1
with	1
only	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
longer	1
wrinkles	1
in	1
the	1

now	1
faded	1
away	1
i	1

his	1

be	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
prairie	1
like	1
placidity	1

pressed	1
by	1

against	1
the	1
vessel	1

side	1
so	1
as	1
firmly	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1

not	1
this	1
whole	1

seem	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
an	1
enormous	1
practical	1
resolution	1
in	1
facing	1

you	1

simply	1

remark	1
its	1
front	1
aspect	1
in	1
all	1
its	1

i	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
investigate	1

now	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
view	1
of	1
forming	1
to	1
yourself	1
some	1
unexaggerated	1
intelligent	1
estimate	1
of	1
whatever	1
battering	1

power	1
may	1
be	1
lodged	1
there	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
vital	1
point	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
either	1
satisfactorily	1
settle	1
this	1
matter	1
with	1
yourself	1
or	1
for	1
ever	1
remain	1
an	1
infidel	1
as	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
true	1
events	1
perhaps	1
anywhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
all	1
recorded	1
history	1
	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
swimming	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
presents	1
an	1
almost	1
wholly	1
vertical	1
plane	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
front	1
slopes	1
considerably	1
backwards	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
furnish	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
retreat	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
socket	1
which	1
receives	1
the	1
boom	1
like	1
lower	1
jaw	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
mouth	1
is	1
entirely	1
under	1
the	1
head	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
indeed	1
as	1
though	1
your	1
own	1
mouth	1
were	1
entirely	1
under	1
your	1
chin	1
moreover	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
external	1
nose	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
nose	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
spout	1
hole	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
you	1
observe	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
nearly	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
his	1
entire	1
length	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
wherefore	1
you	1
must	1
now	1
have	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
is	1
a	1
dead	1
blind	1
wall	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
organ	1
or	1
tender	1
prominence	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
whatsoever	1
furthermore	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
extreme	1
lower	1
backward	1
sloping	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
there	1
the	1
slightest	1
vestige	1
of	1
bone	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
you	1
get	1
near	1
twenty	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
forehead	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
cranial	1
development	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
whole	1
enormous	1
boneless	1
mass	1
is	1
as	1
one	1
wad	1
finally	1
though	1
as	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
revealed	1
its	1
contents	1
partly	1
comprise	1
the	1
most	1
delicate	1
oil	1
yet	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
substance	1
which	1
so	1
impregnably	1
invests	1
all	1
that	1
apparent	1
effeminacy	1
in	1
some	1
previous	1
place	1
i	1
have	1
described	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
the	1
blubber	1
wraps	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
the	1
rind	1
wraps	1
an	1
orange	1
just	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
difference	1
about	1
the	1
head	1
this	1
envelope	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
thick	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
boneless	1
toughness	1
inestimable	1
by	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
handled	1
it	1
the	1
severest	1
pointed	1
harpoon	1
the	1
sharpest	1
lance	1
darted	1
by	1
the	1
strongest	1
human	1
arm	1
impotently	1
rebounds	1
from	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
forehead	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
were	1
paved	1
with	1
horses	1
hoofs	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
sensation	1
lurks	1
in	1
it	1
	1
bethink	1
yourself	1
also	1
of	1
another	1
thing	1
when	1
two	1
large	1
loaded	1
indiamen	1
chance	1
to	1
crowd	1
and	1
crush	1
towards	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
docks	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
sailors	1
do	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
suspend	1
between	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coming	1
contact	1
any	1
merely	1
hard	1
substance	1
like	1
iron	1
or	1
wood	1
no	1
they	1
hold	1
there	1
a	1
large	1
round	1
wad	1
of	1
tow	1
and	1
cork	1
enveloped	1
in	1
the	1
thickest	1
and	1
toughest	1
of	1
ox	1
hide	1
that	1
bravely	1
and	1
uninjured	1
takes	1
the	1
jam	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
snapped	1
all	1
their	1
oaken	1
handspikes	1
and	1
iron	1
crow	1
bars	1
by	1
itself	1
this	1
sufficiently	1
illustrates	1
the	1
obvious	1
fact	1
i	1
drive	1
at	1
but	1
supplementary	1
to	1
this	1
it	1
has	1
hypothetically	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
as	1
ordinary	1
fish	1
possess	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
swimming	1
bladder	1
in	1
them	1
capable	1
at	1
will	1
of	1
distension	1
or	1
contraction	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
know	1
has	1
no	1
such	1
provision	1
in	1
him	1
considering	1
too	1
the	1
otherwise	1
inexplicable	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
now	1
depresses	1
his	1
head	1
altogether	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
anon	1
swims	1
with	1
it	1
high	1
elevated	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
considering	1
the	1
unobstructed	1
elasticity	1
of	1
its	1
envelope	1
considering	1
the	1
unique	1
interior	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
it	1
has	1
hypothetically	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
mystical	1
lung	1
celled	1
honeycombs	1
there	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
some	1
hitherto	1
unknown	1
and	1
unsuspected	1
connexion	1
with	1
the	1
outer	1
air	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
susceptible	1
to	1
atmospheric	1
distension	1
and	1
contraction	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
so	1
fancy	1
the	1
irresistibleness	1
of	1
that	1
might	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
most	1
impalpable	1
and	1
destructive	1
of	1
all	1
elements	1
contributes	1
	1
now	1
mark	1
unerringly	1
impelling	1
this	1
dead	1
impregnable	1
uninjurable	1
wall	1
and	1
this	1
most	1
buoyant	1
thing	1
within	1
there	1
swims	1
behind	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
tremendous	1
life	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
adequately	1
estimated	1
as	1
piled	1
wood	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
cord	1
and	1
all	1
obedient	1
to	1
one	1
volition	1
as	1
the	1
smallest	1
insect	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
shall	1
hereafter	1
detail	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
specialities	1
and	1
concentrations	1
of	1
potency	1
everywhere	1
lurking	1
in	1
this	1
expansive	1
monster	1
when	1
i	1
shall	1
show	1
you	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
more	1

have	1
renounced	1

	1
now	1
comes	1
the	1
baling	1
of	1
the	1
case	1

to	1
comprehend	1
it	1
aright	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
curious	1
internal	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1

operated	1
upon	1
	1
regarding	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
solid	1
oblong	1
you	1
may	1
on	1
an	1
inclined	1
plane	1
sideways	1
divide	1
it	1
into	1
two	1
quoins	1
whereof	1
the	1
lower	1
is	1
the	1
bony	1
structure	1
forming	1
the	1
cranium	1
and	1
jaws	1
and	1
the	1
upper	1
an	1
unctuous	1
mass	1
wholly	1
free	1
from	1
bones	1
its	1
broad	1
forward	1
end	1
forming	1
the	1
expanded	1
vertical	1

of	1
the	1
whale	1
at	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
forehead	1
horizontally	1
subdivide	1
this	1
upper	1
quoin	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
two	1
almost	1
equal	1
parts	1
which	1
before	1
were	1
naturally	1
divided	1
by	1
an	1
internal	1
wall	1
of	1

that	1
it	1

before	1
a	1

is	1
a	1
solid	1
which	1
differs	1
from	1
a	1

the	1

the	1

may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
as	1
that	1
famous	1

mystically	1
carved	1
in	1

so	1
the	1

forms	1
innumerable	1
strange	1
devices	1
for	1
the	1

of	1

replenished	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
of	1
the	1
wines	1
of	1
the	1
rhenish	1
valleys	1
so	1
the	1
tun	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
contains	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
oily	1
vintages	1
namely	1
the	1
highly	1
prized	1

in	1

the	1

again	1

caught	1
by	1
an	1

and	1
quickly	1
emptied	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
tub	1
then	1
remounting	1
aloft	1
it	1
again	1
goes	1
through	1
the	1

round	1
until	1
the	1

will	1
yield	1
no	1
more	1
towards	1

harder	1

harder	1

deeper	1

deeper	1

the	1

some	1

in	1
this	1

several	1

filled	1
with	1
the	1
fragrant	1
sperm	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
queer	1
accident	1
happened	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
tashtego	1
that	1
wild	1
indian	1
was	1
so	1
heedless	1
and	1
reckless	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
his	1
one	1
handed	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
cabled	1
tackles	1
suspending	1
the	1
head	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
was	1
so	1
treacherous	1
and	1
oozy	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
evil	1
one	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
so	1
without	1
stating	1
his	1
particular	1
reasons	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1
now	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
as	1
the	1
eightieth	1
or	1
ninetieth	1
bucket	1
came	1
suckingly	1
up	1
my	1
god	1
poor	1
tashtego	1
like	1
the	1
twin	1
reciprocating	1
bucket	1
in	1
a	1
veritable	1
well	1
dropped	1
head	1
foremost	1
down	1
into	1
this	1
great	1
tun	1
of	1
heidelburgh	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
oily	1
gurgling	1
went	1
clean	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
	1
man	1
overboard	1
cried	1
daggoo	1
who	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
consternation	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
swing	1
the	1
bucket	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
putting	1
one	1
foot	1
into	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
slippery	1
hand	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
whip	1
itself	1
the	1
hoisters	1
ran	1
him	1
high	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
almost	1
before	1
tashtego	1
could	1
have	1
reached	1
its	1
interior	1
bottom	1
meantime	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
terrible	1
tumult	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
before	1
lifeless	1
head	1
throbbing	1
and	1
heaving	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
moment	1
seized	1
with	1
some	1
momentous	1
idea	1
whereas	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
poor	1
indian	1
unconsciously	1
revealing	1
by	1
those	1
struggles	1
the	1
perilous	1
depth	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sunk	1
	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
while	1
daggoo	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
clearing	1
the	1
whip	1
which	1
had	1
somehow	1
got	1
foul	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cutting	1
tackles	1
a	1
sharp	1
cracking	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unspeakable	1
horror	1
of	1
all	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
enormous	1
hooks	1
suspending	1
the	1
head	1
tore	1
out	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
vast	1
vibration	1
the	1
enormous	1
mass	1
sideways	1
swung	1
till	1
the	1
drunk	1
ship	1
reeled	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
smitten	1
by	1
an	1
iceberg	1
the	1
one	1
remaining	1
hook	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
entire	1
strain	1
now	1
depended	1
seemed	1
every	1
instant	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
giving	1
way	1
an	1
event	1
still	1
more	1
likely	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
	1
come	1
down	1
come	1
down	1
yelled	1
the	1
seamen	1
to	1
daggoo	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
heavy	1
tackles	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
head	1
should	1
drop	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
suspended	1
the	1
negro	1
having	1
cleared	1
the	1
foul	1
line	1
rammed	1
down	1
the	1
bucket	1
into	1
the	1
now	1
collapsed	1
well	1
meaning	1
that	1
the	1
buried	1
harpooneer	1
should	1
grasp	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
be	1
hoisted	1
out	1
	1

a	1
voice	1

of	1

	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1

with	1
a	1
thunder	1

the	1
enormous	1

dropped	1
into	1

down	1

hardly	1
had	1
the	1

cleared	1
away	1
when	1
a	1
naked	1
figure	1
with	1
a	1
boarding	1

in	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
for	1
one	1
swift	1
moment	1
seen	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
the	1
next	1
a	1
loud	1
splash	1
announced	1
that	1
my	1
brave	1
queequeg	1
had	1
dived	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
one	1
packed	1
rush	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
counted	1
every	1
ripple	1
as	1
moment	1
followed	1
moment	1
and	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
either	1
the	1
sinker	1
or	1
the	1
diver	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
some	1
hands	1
now	1
jumped	1
into	1
a	1
boat	1
alongside	1

pushed	1
a	1
little	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
	1

cried	1
daggoo	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
his	1
now	1
quiet	1
swinging	1
perch	1
overhead	1
and	1
looking	1
further	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
we	1
saw	1
an	1
arm	1
thrust	1
upright	1
from	1
the	1
blue	1
waves	1
a	1
sight	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
as	1
an	1
arm	1
thrust	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
grass	1
over	1
a	1
grave	1
	1
both	1
both	1
it	1

both	1
cried	1

again	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
shout	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
queequeg	1
was	1
seen	1
boldly	1
striking	1
out	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
clutching	1
the	1
long	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
indian	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
boat	1
they	1
were	1
quickly	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
but	1
tashtego	1
was	1
long	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
and	1
queequeg	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
very	1
brisk	1
	1
now	1
how	1
had	1
this	1
noble	1
rescue	1
been	1
accomplished	1
why	1
diving	1
after	1
the	1
slowly	1
descending	1
head	1
queequeg	1
with	1
his	1
keen	1
sword	1
had	1
made	1
side	1
lunges	1
near	1
its	1
bottom	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
scuttle	1
a	1
large	1
hole	1
there	1
then	1
dropping	1
his	1
sword	1
had	1
thrust	1
his	1
long	1
arm	1
far	1
inwards	1
and	1
upwards	1
and	1
so	1
hauled	1
out	1
poor	1
tash	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
he	1
averred	1
that	1
upon	1
first	1
thrusting	1
in	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
leg	1
was	1
presented	1
but	1
well	1
knowing	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
might	1
occasion	1
great	1
trouble	1
he	1
had	1
thrust	1
back	1
the	1
leg	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
dexterous	1
heave	1
and	1
toss	1
had	1
wrought	1
a	1
somerset	1
upon	1
the	1
indian	1
so	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
trial	1
he	1
came	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
way	1
head	1
foremost	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
head	1
itself	1
that	1
was	1
doing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
expected	1
	1
and	1
thus	1
through	1
the	1

in	1
obstetrics	1
of	1
queequeg	1
the	1
deliverance	1

in	1
the	1
teeth	1
too	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
untoward	1

impediments	1

is	1
a	1
lesson	1

no	1

not	1
seldom	1
happens	1

with	1
much	1

we	1

the	1

the	1

the	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

materially	1
counteracted	1
by	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

remaining	1
undetached	1
from	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
sank	1

physiognomically	1
regarded	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
an	1
anomalous	1
creature	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
nose	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
nose	1
is	1
the	1
central	1
and	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
of	1
the	1
features	1
and	1
since	1
it	1
perhaps	1
most	1
modifies	1
and	1
finally	1
controls	1
their	1
combined	1
expression	1
hence	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
that	1
its	1
entire	1
absence	1
as	1
an	1
external	1
appendage	1
must	1
very	1
largely	1
affect	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1

for	1
as	1
in	1
landscape	1

a	1
spire	1
cupola	1
monument	1

of	1
some	1
sort	1
is	1
deemed	1
almost	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
so	1
no	1

of	1
so	1
mighty	1
a	1
magnitude	1
all	1

so	1
stately	1
that	1
the	1

deficiency	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
sculptured	1

were	1
hideous	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1

it	1
is	1
an	1
added	1
grandeur	1
a	1
nose	1
to	1
the	1

would	1
have	1
been	1
impertinent	1
as	1
on	1
your	1

his	1

head	1
in	1
your	1
jolly	1

your	1
noble	1
conceptions	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
never	1
insulted	1
by	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
nose	1
to	1
be	1
pulled	1
a	1
pestilent	1
conceit	1
which	1
so	1
often	1
will	1
insist	1
upon	1
obtruding	1
even	1
when	1
beholding	1
the	1
mightiest	1
royal	1
beadle	1
on	1
his	1

	1
in	1
some	1
particulars	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
imposing	1
physiognomical	1
view	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
of	1

this	1
aspect	1

sublime	1
	1
in	1
thought	1
a	1
fine	1

when	1
troubled	1
with	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
repose	1
of	1
the	1
pasture	1
the	1

of	1

majestic	1
human	1

animal	1
the	1

golden	1
seal	1
affixed	1
by	1
the	1

to	1
their	1

in	1
most	1
creatures	1
nay	1
in	1

himself	1
very	1
often	1
the	1

is	1

a	1
mere	1
strip	1
of	1
alpine	1
land	1
lying	1
along	1
the	1
snow	1
line	1
few	1
are	1
the	1
foreheads	1
which	1
like	1
shakespeare	1
s	1

s	1
rise	1
so	1
high	1
and	1
descend	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
the	1

all	1
above	1
them	1
in	1
the	1

to	1
track	1
the	1
antlered	1
thoughts	1
descending	1
there	1

drink	1
as	1
the	1
highland	1

in	1
the	1

whale	1
this	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
god	1
like	1
dignity	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
brow	1
is	1
so	1
immensely	1
amplified	1
that	1
gazing	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
full	1
front	1
view	1
you	1
feel	1
the	1
deity	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
powers	1
more	1
forcibly	1
than	1
in	1
beholding	1
any	1

revealed	1
no	1
nose	1

no	1

he	1
has	1
none	1
proper	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
broad	1
firmament	1
of	1
a	1
forehead	1
pleated	1
with	1
riddles	1
dumbly	1
lowering	1
with	1
the	1
doom	1
of	1
boats	1
and	1
ships	1
and	1
men	1
nor	1
in	1
profile	1
does	1
this	1
wondrous	1
brow	1
diminish	1
though	1
that	1
way	1
viewed	1
its	1
grandeur	1
does	1
not	1
domineer	1
upon	1
you	1
so	1
in	1
profile	1
you	1
plainly	1
perceive	1
that	1
horizontal	1
semi	1
crescentic	1
depression	1
in	1
the	1
forehead	1
s	1
middle	1
which	1
in	1
man	1
is	1
lavater	1
s	1
mark	1
of	1
genius	1
	1
but	1
how	1
genius	1
in	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
has	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
ever	1
written	1
a	1
book	1
spoken	1
a	1
speech	1
no	1
his	1
great	1
genius	1
is	1
declared	1
in	1
his	1
doing	1
nothing	1
particular	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
moreover	1
declared	1
in	1
his	1
pyramidical	1
silence	1
and	1
this	1
reminds	1
me	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
great	1
sperm	1
whale	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
orient	1
world	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
deified	1
by	1
their	1
child	1
magian	1
thoughts	1
they	1
deified	1
the	1
crocodile	1
of	1
the	1
nile	1
because	1
the	1
crocodile	1
is	1
tongueless	1
and	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
tongue	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
small	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
protrusion	1

of	1

	1

the	1

among	1
a	1

you	1
would	1

it	1
with	1
them	1

remarking	1
the	1
depressions	1
on	1
one	1

of	1
its	1

in	1
phrenological	1
phrase	1
you	1
would	1
say	1
this	1
man	1
had	1
no	1
self	1
esteem	1

no	1
veneration	1
and	1
by	1
those	1
negations	1
considered	1
along	1
with	1
the	1

fact	1
of	1
his	1
prodigious	1

you	1
can	1
best	1
form	1
to	1
yourself	1
the	1

not	1
the	1
most	1
exhilarating	1
conception	1
of	1
what	1

is	1
	1
but	1
if	1
from	1
the	1
comparative	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
proper	1
brain	1
you	1
deem	1
it	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
adequately	1
charted	1
then	1
i	1
have	1
another	1
idea	1
for	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
attentively	1
regard	1
almost	1
any	1
quadruped	1
s	1
spine	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
resemblance	1
of	1
its	1
vertebrae	1
to	1
a	1
strung	1
necklace	1
of	1
dwarfed	1
skulls	1
all	1
bearing	1
rudimental	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
skull	1
proper	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
german	1
conceit	1
that	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
are	1
absolutely	1
undeveloped	1
skulls	1
but	1
the	1
curious	1
external	1
resemblance	1
i	1
take	1
it	1
the	1
germans	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
men	1
to	1
perceive	1
a	1
foreign	1
friend	1
once	1
pointed	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
foe	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
inlaying	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
basso	1
relievo	1
the	1
beaked	1
prow	1
of	1
his	1
canoe	1
now	1
i	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
phrenologists	1
have	1
omitted	1
an	1
important	1
thing	1
in	1
not	1
pushing	1
their	1
investigations	1
from	1
the	1
cerebellum	1
through	1
the	1
spinal	1

for	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
character	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
betokened	1
in	1
his	1
backbone	1
i	1
would	1
rather	1
feel	1
your	1
spine	1
than	1
your	1

whoever	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
thin	1
joist	1
of	1
a	1

never	1
yet	1
upheld	1
a	1
full	1

noble	1
soul	1
i	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1

as	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
that	1

which	1
i	1
fling	1
half	1
out	1

this	1

in	1

ten	1

viewed	1
in	1
this	1

the	1

not	1

judgment	1
descended	1
upon	1

caught	1

midship	1
oarsman	1

was	1

while	1
in	1
consequence	1

away	1
at	1
his	1

in	1
a	1
mighty	1
rage	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
time	1
for	1
starbuck	1

flask	1
with	1
a	1
shout	1

took	1
a	1
mortal	1
start	1
forwards	1
and	1
slantingly	1
ranged	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
german	1
s	1
quarter	1
an	1
instant	1
more	1
and	1
all	1
four	1
boats	1
were	1
diagonically	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
immediate	1
wake	1
while	1
stretching	1
from	1
them	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
was	1
the	1
foaming	1
swell	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
terrific	1
most	1
pitiable	1
and	1
maddening	1
sight	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
head	1
out	1
and	1
sending	1
his	1
spout	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
tormented	1
jet	1
while	1
his	1
one	1
poor	1
fin	1
beat	1
his	1
side	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
fright	1
now	1
to	1
this	1
hand	1
now	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
yawed	1
in	1
his	1
faltering	1
flight	1
and	1
still	1
at	1
every	1
billow	1
that	1
he	1
broke	1
he	1
spasmodically	1
sank	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
or	1
sideways	1
rolled	1
towards	1
the	1
sky	1
his	1
one	1
beating	1
fin	1
so	1
have	1
i	1
seen	1
a	1
bird	1
with	1
clipped	1
wing	1
making	1
affrighted	1
broken	1
circles	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
vainly	1
striving	1
to	1
escape	1

piratical	1
hawks	1

the	1
bird	1
has	1
a	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
plaintive	1
cries	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
her	1
fear	1
but	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
this	1
vast	1
dumb	1
brute	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
chained	1
up	1
and	1
enchanted	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
voice	1
save	1
that	1
choking	1
respiration	1
through	1
his	1
spiracle	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
unspeakably	1
pitiable	1
while	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
amazing	1
bulk	1
portcullis	1
jaw	1
and	1
omnipotent	1
tail	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
appal	1
the	1
stoutest	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
pitied	1
	1
seeing	1
now	1
that	1

a	1
very	1
few	1
moments	1
more	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
pequod	1

the	1
advantage	1

rather	1
than	1
be	1
thus	1
foiled	1
of	1
his	1
game	1
derick	1
chose	1
to	1
hazard	1
what	1
to	1
him	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
a	1
most	1
unusually	1
long	1
dart	1
ere	1
the	1
last	1
chance	1
would	1
for	1

	1

no	1

all	1

the	1

spouting	1
thick	1

up	1

spout	1
as	1
when	1
by	1
unseen	1
hands	1
the	1

is	1
gradually	1
drawn	1
off	1
from	1

with	1
half	1
stifled	1
melancholy	1
gurglings	1
the	1

lowers	1

lowers	1
to	1
the	1

so	1
the	1
last	1
long	1
dying	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
	1
soon	1
while	1
the	1
crews	1
were	1
awaiting	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
body	1
showed	1
symptoms	1
of	1
sinking	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
treasures	1
unrifled	1
immediately	1
by	1
starbuck	1
s	1
orders	1
lines	1
were	1
secured	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
different	1
points	1
so	1
that	1
ere	1
long	1
every	1
boat	1
was	1
a	1
buoy	1
the	1
sunken	1
whale	1
being	1
suspended	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
beneath	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
cords	1
by	1
very	1
heedful	1
management	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
drew	1
nigh	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
was	1
strongly	1
secured	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
stiffest	1
fluke	1
chains	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
unless	1
artificially	1
upheld	1
the	1
body	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
	1
it	1
so	1
chanced	1
that	1
almost	1
upon	1
first	1
cutting	1
into	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spade	1
the	1
entire	1
length	1
of	1
a	1
corroded	1
harpoon	1
was	1
found	1
imbedded	1
in	1
his	1
flesh	1
on	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
bunch	1
before	1
described	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
stumps	1
of	1
harpoons	1
are	1
frequently	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
captured	1
whales	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
perfectly	1
healed	1
around	1
them	1
and	1
no	1
prominence	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
to	1
denote	1
their	1
place	1
therefore	1
there	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
other	1
unknown	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
fully	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
ulceration	1
alluded	1
to	1
but	1
still	1
more	1
curious	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
a	1
lance	1
head	1
of	1
stone	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
him	1
not	1
far	1
from	1

firm	1
about	1
it	1

darted	1
that	1
stone	1

when	1
it	1

have	1
been	1
darted	1
by	1
some	1

rummaged	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
monstrous	1
cabinet	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
telling	1

a	1
sudden	1
stop	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
further	1
discoveries	1
by	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
being	1
unprecedentedly	1
dragged	1
over	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1

immensely	1
increasing	1
tendency	1
to	1
sink	1

on	1
to	1

so	1
resolutely	1
indeed	1
that	1
when	1

have	1
been	1
capsized	1

is	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
thing	1
nor	1
has	1
any	1

yet	1
adequately	1
accounted	1
for	1
it	1
usually	1
the	1
dead	1
sperm	1

floats	1
with	1
great	1
buoyancy	1
with	1
its	1
side	1
or	1
belly	1
considerably	1
elevated	1
above	1
the	1
surface	1
if	1
the	1
only	1
whales	1
that	1
thus	1
sank	1
were	1
old	1
meagre	1
and	1
broken	1
hearted	1
creatures	1

pads	1
of	1
lard	1
diminished	1

all	1
their	1
bones	1
heavy	1
and	1
rheumatic	1
then	1
you	1
might	1
with	1
some	1
reason	1
assert	1
that	1
this	1
sinking	1
is	1
caused	1
by	1
an	1
uncommon	1
specific	1
gravity	1
in	1
the	1
fish	1
so	1
sinking	1
consequent	1
upon	1
this	1
absence	1
of	1
buoyant	1
matter	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
for	1
young	1
whales	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
health	1
and	1
swelling	1
with	1
noble	1
aspirations	1
prematurely	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
warm	1
flush	1
and	1
may	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
panting	1
lard	1
about	1
them	1
even	1
these	1
brawny	1
buoyant	1
heroes	1
do	1
sometimes	1
sink	1
	1
be	1
it	1
said	1
however	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
far	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
this	1
accident	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
species	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
go	1
down	1
twenty	1
right	1
whales	1
do	1
this	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
species	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
imputable	1
in	1
no	1
small	1
degree	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
quantity	1
of	1
bone	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
his	1
venetian	1
blinds	1
alone	1
sometimes	1
weighing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
ton	1
from	1
this	1
incumbrance	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
wholly	1
free	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
instances	1
where	1
after	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
many	1
hours	1
or	1
several	1
days	1
the	1
sunken	1
whale	1
again	1
rises	1
more	1
buoyant	1
than	1
in	1
life	1
but	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
obvious	1
gases	1
are	1
generated	1
in	1

plenty	1

that	1

the	1

this	1

the	1

certainly	1

in	1
the	1

now	1
some	1
nantucketers	1
rather	1
distrust	1
this	1
historical	1
story	1
of	1
jonah	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
but	1
then	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
sceptical	1
greeks	1
and	1
romans	1
who	1
standing	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
orthodox	1
pagans	1
of	1
their	1
times	1
equally	1
doubted	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
hercules	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
arion	1
and	1
the	1
dolphin	1
and	1
yet	1
their	1
doubting	1
those	1
traditions	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
those	1
traditions	1
one	1
whit	1
the	1
less	1
facts	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
	1
one	1
old	1
sag	1
harbor	1
whaleman	1
s	1
chief	1
reason	1
for	1
questioning	1
the	1
hebrew	1
story	1
was	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
quaint	1
old	1
fashioned	1
bibles	1
embellished	1
with	1
curious	1
unscientific	1
plates	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
represented	1
jonah	1
s	1
whale	1
with	1
two	1
spouts	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
only	1
true	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
varieties	1
of	1
that	1
order	1
concerning	1
which	1
the	1
fishermen	1
have	1
this	1
saying	1
a	1
penny	1
roll	1
would	1
choke	1
him	1
his	1
swallow	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
small	1
but	1
to	1
this	1
bishop	1
jebb	1
s	1
anticipative	1
answer	1
is	1
ready	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
hints	1
the	1
bishop	1
that	1
we	1
consider	1
jonah	1
as	1
tombed	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
belly	1
but	1
as	1
temporarily	1
lodged	1
in	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
this	1
seems	1
reasonable	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
bishop	1
for	1
truly	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
s	1
mouth	1
would	1
accommodate	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
whist	1
tables	1
and	1
comfortably	1
seat	1
all	1
the	1
players	1
possibly	1
too	1
jonah	1
might	1
have	1
ensconced	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
tooth	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
the	1
right	1
whale	1
is	1
toothless	1
	1
another	1
reason	1
which	1
sag	1
harbor	1
he	1
went	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
urged	1
for	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
faith	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
was	1
something	1
obscurely	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
his	1
incarcerated	1
body	1
and	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
gastric	1
juices	1
but	1
this	1
objection	1
likewise	1
falls	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
because	1
a	1
german	1
exegetist	1
supposes	1
that	1
jonah	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
floating	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
whale	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
french	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
russian	1
campaign	1
turned	1
their	1
dead	1
horses	1
into	1
tents	1
and	1
crawled	1
into	1
them	1
besides	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
divined	1
by	1
other	1
continental	1
commentators	1
that	1
when	1
jonah	1
was	1
thrown	1
overboard	1
from	1
the	1
joppa	1
ship	1
he	1
straightway	1
effected	1
his	1
escape	1
to	1
another	1
vessel	1
near	1
by	1
some	1
vessel	1
with	1
a	1
whale	1
for	1
a	1
figure	1
head	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
add	1
possibly	1
called	1
the	1
whale	1
as	1
some	1
craft	1
are	1
nowadays	1
christened	1
the	1
shark	1
the	1
gull	1
the	1
eagle	1
nor	1
have	1
there	1
been	1
wanting	1
learned	1
exegetists	1
who	1
have	1
opined	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
jonah	1
merely	1
meant	1
a	1
life	1
preserver	1
an	1
inflated	1
bag	1
of	1
wind	1
which	1
the	1
endangered	1
prophet	1
swam	1
to	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
saved	1
from	1
a	1
watery	1
doom	1
poor	1
sag	1
harbor	1
therefore	1
seems	1
worsted	1
all	1
round	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
faith	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
if	1
i	1
remember	1
right	1
jonah	1
was	1
swallowed	1
by	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
sea	1
and	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
was	1
vomited	1
up	1
somewhere	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
journey	1
of	1
nineveh	1
a	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
tigris	1
very	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
days	1
journey	1
across	1
from	1
the	1
nearest	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
coast	1
how	1
is	1
that	1
	1
but	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
whale	1
to	1
land	1
the	1
prophet	1
within	1
that	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
nineveh	1
yes	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
carried	1
him	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
good	1
hope	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
and	1
another	1
passage	1
up	1
the	1
persian	1
gulf	1
and	1
red	1
sea	1
such	1
a	1
supposition	1
would	1
involve	1
the	1
complete	1
circumnavigation	1
of	1
all	1
africa	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
tigris	1
waters	1
near	1
the	1
site	1
of	1
nineveh	1
being	1
too	1
shallow	1
for	1
any	1
whale	1
to	1
swim	1
in	1
besides	1
this	1
idea	1
of	1
jonah	1
s	1
weathering	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
good	1
hope	1
at	1
so	1
early	1
a	1
day	1
would	1
wrest	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
headland	1
from	1
bartholomew	1
diaz	1
its	1
reputed	1
discoverer	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
modern	1
history	1
a	1
liar	1
	1
but	1
all	1
these	1
foolish	1
arguments	1
of	1
old	1
sag	1
harbor	1
only	1
evinced	1
his	1
foolish	1
pride	1
of	1
reason	1
a	1
thing	1
still	1
more	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
him	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
little	1
learning	1
except	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
i	1
say	1
it	1
only	1
shows	1
his	1
foolish	1
impious	1
pride	1
and	1
abominable	1
devilish	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1

of	1
jonah	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
nineveh	1
via	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
good	1
hope	1
was	1
advanced	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
magnification	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
miracle	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
besides	1
to	1

some	1

an	1

upon	1

that	1

can	1
do	1
no	1

one	1
morning	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
german	1
ship	1

disappeared	1
took	1
more	1
than	1

in	1
that	1
occupation	1
crawling	1
under	1

it	1
hung	1
over	1

it	1

by	1

	1
towards	1

so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1

down	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
with	1
swift	1
precipitancy	1

disordered	1
flight	1
as	1
of	1

still	1
continued	1
his	1

flight	1
with	1
added	1

upon	1
the	1
planted	1
iron	1

sooner	1
or	1
later	1
inevitably	1
extract	1
it	1
it	1
became	1
imperative	1
to	1
lance	1
the	1
flying	1
whale	1
or	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
lose	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
haul	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
flank	1
was	1
impossible	1
he	1
swam	1
so	1
fast	1
and	1
furious	1
what	1
then	1
remained	1
	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
wondrous	1
devices	1

of	1

and	1
countless	1
subtleties	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
veteran	1
whaleman	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
forced	1
none	1
exceed	1
that	1
fine	1
manoeuvre	1
with	1
the	1
lance	1
called	1
pitchpoling	1
small	1
sword	1
or	1
broad	1
sword	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
exercises	1
boasts	1
nothing	1

only	1
indispensable	1
with	1
an	1
inveterate	1
running	1
whale	1
its	1
grand	1
fact	1
and	1
feature	1
is	1
the	1
wonderful	1
distance	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
long	1
lance	1
is	1
accurately	1
darted	1
from	1

violently	1
rocking	1
jerking	1
boat	1
under	1
extreme	1
headway	1
steel	1

included	1
the	1
entire	1

some	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
feet	1
in	1
length	1
the	1
staff	1
is	1
much	1
slighter	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

also	1
of	1
a	1
lighter	1
material	1
pine	1
it	1

furnished	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
rope	1
called	1
a	1
warp	1
of	1
considerable	1
length	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
hauled	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
after	1
darting	1
	1
but	1
before	1
going	1
further	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
mention	1
here	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
harpoon	1
may	1
be	1
pitchpoled	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
lance	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
seldom	1
done	1
and	1
when	1
done	1
is	1
still	1
less	1
frequently	1
successful	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
weight	1
and	1
inferior	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
lance	1
which	1
in	1
effect	1
become	1
serious	1
drawbacks	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing	1
therefore	1

at	1

times	1
is	1
combined	1
with	1
the	1
element	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
swim	1
hence	1
a	1
herring	1
or	1
a	1
cod	1
might	1
live	1
a	1
century	1
and	1
never	1
once	1
raise	1
its	1
head	1
above	1
the	1
surface	1
but	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
marked	1
internal	1
structure	1
which	1
gives	1
him	1
regular	1
lungs	1
like	1
a	1
human	1

the	1

can	1
only	1
live	1
by	1
inhaling	1
the	1

air	1
in	1
the	1

atmosphere	1
wherefore	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
his	1
periodical	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
world	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1

is	1

at	1

what	1
is	1

that	1
in	1
any	1
creature	1
breathing	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
function	1
indispensable	1
to	1
vitality	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
withdraws	1
from	1

a	1
certain	1
element	1
which	1

subsequently	1
brought	1
into	1

with	1

to	1
the	1

principle	1

not	1

shall	1
err	1

i	1
may	1
possibly	1
use	1
some	1
superfluous	1
scientific	1
words	1
assume	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
be	1
aerated	1
with	1
one	1
breath	1
he	1
might	1
then	1
seal	1
up	1
his	1
nostrils	1
and	1
not	1
fetch	1
another	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
live	1
without	1
breathing	1
anomalous	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
this	1
is	1
precisely	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
who	1
systematically	1
lives	1
by	1
intervals	1
his	1
full	1
hour	1
and	1
more	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
without	1
drawing	1
a	1
single	1
breath	1
or	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
inhaling	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
air	1
for	1
remember	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
gills	1
how	1
is	1
this	1
between	1
his	1
ribs	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
spine	1
he	1
is	1
supplied	1
with	1
a	1
remarkable	1
involved	1
cretan	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
vermicelli	1
like	1
vessels	1
which	1
vessels	1
when	1
he	1
quits	1
the	1
surface	1
are	1
completely	1
distended	1
with	1
oxygenated	1
blood	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
a	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
he	1
carries	1
a	1
surplus	1
stock	1
of	1
vitality	1
in	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
camel	1
crossing	1
the	1
waterless	1
desert	1
carries	1
a	1
surplus	1
supply	1
of	1
drink	1
for	1
future	1
use	1
in	1
its	1
four	1
supplementary	1
stomachs	1
the	1
anatomical	1
fact	1
of	1
this	1
labyrinth	1
is	1
indisputable	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
founded	1
upon	1
it	1
is	1
reasonable	1
and	1
true	1
seems	1
the	1
more	1
cogent	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
consider	1
the	1
otherwise	1
inexplicable	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
that	1
leviathan	1
in	1
having	1
his	1
spoutings	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
fishermen	1
phrase	1
it	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1
if	1
unmolested	1
upon	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
will	1
continue	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
exactly	1
uniform	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
other	1
unmolested	1
risings	1
say	1
he	1
stays	1
eleven	1
minutes	1
and	1
jets	1
seventy	1
times	1
that	1
is	1
respires	1
seventy	1
breaths	1
then	1
whenever	1
he	1
rises	1
again	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
seventy	1
breaths	1
over	1
again	1
to	1
a	1
minute	1
now	1
if	1
after	1
he	1
fetches	1
a	1
few	1
breaths	1
you	1
alarm	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
sounds	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
dodging	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
make	1
good	1
his	1
regular	1
allowance	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
those	1
seventy	1
breaths	1
are	1
told	1
will	1
he	1
finally	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
stay	1
out	1
his	1
full	1
term	1
below	1
remark	1
however	1
that	1
in	1
different	1
individuals	1
these	1
rates	1
are	1
different	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
they	1
are	1
alike	1
now	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
whale	1
thus	1
insist	1
upon	1
having	1
his	1
spoutings	1
out	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
replenish	1
his	1
reservoir	1
of	1
air	1
ere	1
descending	1
for	1
good	1
how	1
obvious	1
is	1
it	1
too	1
that	1
this	1
necessity	1
for	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
rising	1
exposes	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fatal	1
hazards	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
for	1
not	1
by	1
hook	1
or	1
by	1
net	1
could	1
this	1
vast	1
leviathan	1
be	1
caught	1
when	1
sailing	1
a	1
thousand	1
fathoms	1
beneath	1
the	1
sunlight	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
thy	1
skill	1
then	1
o	1
hunter	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
necessities	1
that	1
strike	1
the	1
victory	1
to	1
thee	1
	1
in	1
man	1
breathing	1
is	1
incessantly	1
going	1
on	1
one	1
breath	1
only	1
serving	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
pulsations	1
so	1
that	1
whatever	1
other	1
business	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
waking	1
or	1
sleeping	1
breathe	1
he	1
must	1
or	1
die	1
he	1
will	1
but	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
only	1
breathes	1
about	1
one	1
seventh	1
or	1
sunday	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
only	1
breathes	1
through	1
his	1
spout	1
hole	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
truthfully	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
his	1
spouts	1
are	1
mixed	1
with	1
water	1
then	1
i	1
opine	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
furnished	1
with	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
seems	1
obliterated	1
in	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
answers	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
is	1
that	1
identical	1
spout	1
hole	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
clogged	1
with	1
two	1
elements	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
smelling	1
but	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
spout	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
water	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
vapour	1
no	1
absolute	1
certainty	1
can	1
as	1
yet	1
be	1
arrived	1
at	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
nevertheless	1
that	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
proper	1
olfactories	1
but	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
of	1
them	1
no	1
roses	1
no	1
violets	1
no	1
cologne	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
furthermore	1
as	1
his	1
windpipe	1
solely	1
opens	1
into	1
the	1
tube	1
of	1
his	1
spouting	1
canal	1
and	1
as	1
that	1
long	1
canal	1
like	1
the	1
grand	1
erie	1
canal	1
is	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
locks	1
that	1
open	1
and	1
shut	1
for	1
the	1
downward	1
retention	1
of	1
air	1
or	1
the	1
upward	1
exclusion	1
of	1
water	1
therefore	1
the	1
whale	1
has	1
no	1
voice	1
unless	1
you	1
insult	1
him	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
so	1
strangely	1
rumbles	1
he	1
talks	1
through	1
his	1
nose	1
but	1
then	1
again	1
what	1
has	1
the	1
whale	1
to	1
say	1
seldom	1
have	1
i	1
known	1
any	1
profound	1
being	1
that	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
world	1
unless	1
forced	1
to	1
stammer	1
out	1
something	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
living	1
oh	1
happy	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
listener	1
	1
now	1
the	1
spouting	1
canal	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
chiefly	1
intended	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
conveyance	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
for	1
several	1
feet	1
laid	1
along	1
horizontally	1
just	1
beneath	1
the	1
upper	1
surface	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
this	1
curious	1
canal	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
gas	1
pipe	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
street	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
returns	1
whether	1
this	1
gas	1
pipe	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
water	1
pipe	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
whether	1
the	1
spout	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
is	1
the	1
mere	1
vapour	1
of	1
the	1
exhaled	1
breath	1
or	1
whether	1
that	1
exhaled	1
breath	1
is	1
mixed	1
with	1
water	1
taken	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
and	1
discharged	1
through	1
the	1
spiracle	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
mouth	1
indirectly	1
communicates	1
with	1
the	1
spouting	1
canal	1
but	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
discharging	1
water	1
through	1
the	1
spiracle	1
because	1
the	1
greatest	1
necessity	1
for	1
so	1
doing	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
when	1
in	1
feeding	1
he	1
accidentally	1
takes	1
in	1
water	1
but	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
food	1
is	1
far	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
there	1
he	1

if	1
he	1
would	1
besides	1
if	1
you	1
regard	1
him	1
very	1
closely	1
and	1
time	1
him	1
with	1
your	1
watch	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
when	1
unmolested	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
undeviating	1
rhyme	1
between	1
the	1
periods	1
of	1
his	1
jets	1
and	1
the	1
ordinary	1
periods	1
of	1

why	1
pester	1

all	1
this	1
reasoning	1
on	1
the	1

speak	1
out	1
you	1

seen	1
him	1

declare	1
what	1
the	1

is	1

you	1
not	1

my	1
dear	1
sir	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
settle	1
these	1
plain	1
things	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
found	1
your	1
plain	1
things	1
the	1
knottiest	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
whale	1
spout	1
you	1
might	1
almost	1
stand	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
undecided	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
precisely	1
	1
the	1

body	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
snowy	1
sparkling	1
mist	1
enveloping	1
it	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
certainly	1
tell	1
whether	1
any	1
water	1
falls	1
from	1
it	1
when	1
always	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
close	1
enough	1
to	1
a	1
whale	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
close	1
view	1
of	1
his	1

he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
prodigious	1
commotion	1
the	1
water	1
cascading	1
all	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
if	1
at	1
such	1
times	1
you	1
should	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
perceived	1
drops	1
of	1
moisture	1
in	1
the	1
spout	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
merely	1
condensed	1
from	1
its	1
vapour	1
or	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
those	1
identical	1
drops	1
superficially	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1

which	1
is	1
countersunk	1
into	1

the	1

carries	1
a	1
small	1

of	1
water	1
on	1
his	1

sometimes	1
see	1
a	1

a	1

up	1
with	1

	1

is	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
prudent	1
for	1
the	1
hunter	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
curious	1
touching	1
the	1
precise	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
spout	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
peering	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
it	1
you	1
cannot	1
go	1
with	1
your	1
pitcher	1
to	1
this	1
fountain	1
and	1
fill	1
it	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
away	1
for	1
even	1
when	1
coming	1
into	1
slight	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
outer	1
vapoury	1
shreds	1
of	1
the	1
jet	1
which	1
will	1
often	1
happen	1
your	1
skin	1
will	1
feverishly	1
smart	1
from	1
the	1
acridness	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
so	1
touching	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
one	1
who	1
coming	1
into	1
still	1
closer	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
spout	1
whether	1
with	1
some	1
scientific	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
or	1
otherwise	1
i	1
cannot	1
say	1
the	1
skin	1
peeled	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
cheek	1
and	1
arm	1
wherefore	1
among	1
whalemen	1
the	1
spout	1
is	1
deemed	1
poisonous	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
evade	1
it	1
another	1
thing	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
much	1
doubt	1
it	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
jet	1
is	1
fairly	1
spouted	1
into	1
your	1
eyes	1
it	1
will	1
blind	1
you	1
the	1
wisest	1
thing	1
the	1
investigator	1
can	1
do	1
then	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
this	1
deadly	1
spout	1
alone	1
	1
still	1
we	1
can	1
hypothesize	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
cannot	1
prove	1
and	1
establish	1
my	1
hypothesis	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
spout	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
mist	1
and	1
besides	1
other	1
reasons	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion	1
i	1
am	1
impelled	1
by	1
considerations	1
touching	1
the	1
great	1
inherent	1
dignity	1
and	1
sublimity	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1

i	1
account	1
him	1
no	1
common	1
shallow	1
being	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
undisputed	1
fact	1
that	1

sometimes	1
are	1
he	1

both	1
ponderous	1

i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
from	1

such	1

the	1

its	1

the	1

considerably	1
exceed	1
twenty	1
feet	1
across	1
	1
the	1
entire	1

a	1
dense	1
webbed	1
bed	1
of	1
welded	1

cut	1

upper	1

the	1

running	1

this	1
triune	1
structure	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anything	1

to	1
the	1
tail	1
to	1
the	1
student	1
of	1
old	1
roman	1

the	1

layer	1
will	1
furnish	1
a	1
curious	1
parallel	1
to	1
the	1

course	1
of	1
tiles	1
always	1
alternating	1
with	1
the	1
stone	1
in	1
those	1
wonderful	1
relics	1
of	1

undoubtedly	1
contribute	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1

as	1

down	1
into	1

largely	1
contribute	1
to	1
their	1
might	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1

the	1
confluent	1
measureless	1
force	1
of	1
the	1

at	1
all	1

to	1
cripple	1
the	1

it	1

your	1

if	1
it	1

sideways	1

then	1
partly	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

result	1
these	1

so	1
often	1
received	1
in	1

that	1

mere	1

off	1

the	1

	1
third	1
i	1
cannot	1
demonstrate	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
touch	1
is	1
concentrated	1
in	1
the	1
tail	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
delicacy	1
in	1
it	1
only	1
equalled	1
by	1
the	1
daintiness	1
of	1
the	1
elephant	1
s	1
trunk	1
this	1
delicacy	1
is	1
chiefly	1
evinced	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
sweeping	1
when	1
in	1
maidenly	1
gentleness	1
the	1
whale	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
soft	1
slowness	1
moves	1
his	1
immense	1
flukes	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
upon	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
feel	1
but	1
a	1
sailor	1
s	1
whisker	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
sailor	1
whiskers	1
and	1
all	1
what	1
tenderness	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
preliminary	1
touch	1
had	1
this	1
tail	1
any	1
prehensile	1
power	1
i	1
should	1
straightway	1
bethink	1
me	1
of	1
darmonodes	1
elephant	1
that	1
so	1
frequented	1
the	1
flower	1
market	1
and	1
with	1
low	1
salutations	1
presented	1
nosegays	1
to	1
damsels	1
and	1
then	1
caressed	1
their	1
zones	1
on	1
more	1
accounts	1
than	1
one	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
does	1
not	1
possess	1
this	1
prehensile	1
virtue	1
in	1
his	1
tail	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
yet	1
another	1
elephant	1
that	1
when	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
fight	1
curved	1
round	1
his	1
trunk	1
and	1
extracted	1
the	1
dart	1
	1
fourth	1
stealing	1
unawares	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
fancied	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
solitary	1
seas	1
you	1
find	1
him	1
unbent	1
from	1
the	1
vast	1
corpulence	1
of	1
his	1
dignity	1
and	1
kitten	1
like	1
he	1
plays	1
on	1
the	1
ocean	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
hearth	1
but	1
still	1
you	1
see	1
his	1
power	1
in	1
his	1
play	1
the	1
broad	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
tail	1
are	1
flirted	1
high	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
then	1
smiting	1
the	1
surface	1
the	1
thunderous	1
concussion	1
resounds	1
for	1
miles	1
you	1
would	1
almost	1
think	1
a	1
great	1
gun	1
had	1
been	1
discharged	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
noticed	1
the	1
light	1
wreath	1
of	1
vapour	1
from	1
the	1
spiracle	1
at	1
his	1
other	1
extremity	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
touch	1
hole	1
	1
fifth	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
floating	1
posture	1
of	1
the	1
leviathan	1
the	1
flukes	1
lie	1
considerably	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
back	1
they	1
are	1
then	1
completely	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
deeps	1
his	1
entire	1
flukes	1
with	1
at	1
least	1
thirty	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
are	1
tossed	1
erect	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
so	1
remain	1
vibrating	1
a	1
moment	1
till	1
they	1
downwards	1
shoot	1
out	1
of	1
view	1
excepting	1
the	1
sublime	1
breach	1
somewhere	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
described	1
this	1
peaking	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
flukes	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
grandest	1
sight	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
animated	1
nature	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
profundities	1
the	1
gigantic	1
tail	1
seems	1
spasmodically	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
heaven	1
so	1
in	1
dreams	1
have	1
i	1
seen	1
majestic	1
satan	1
thrusting	1
forth	1
his	1
tormented	1
colossal	1
claw	1
from	1
the	1
flame	1
baltic	1
of	1
hell	1
but	1
in	1
gazing	1
at	1
such	1
scenes	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
all	1
what	1
mood	1
you	1
are	1
in	1

in	1

heading	1
towards	1
the	1

for	1
a	1

vibrating	1
in	1
concert	1
with	1
peaked	1
flukes	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
such	1
a	1
grand	1
embodiment	1
of	1
adoration	1
of	1
the	1

was	1
never	1

in	1

as	1
ptolemy	1

testified	1
of	1

testified	1
of	1
the	1

pronouncing	1
him	1
the	1
most	1

of	1
all	1
beings	1
for	1
according	1
to	1

hailed	1

with	1

in	1

	1
the	1
chance	1
comparison	1
in	1
this	1
chapter	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
elephant	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
some	1
aspects	1
of	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
are	1
concerned	1
should	1
not	1
tend	1
to	1
place	1
those	1
two	1
opposite	1
organs	1
on	1
an	1
equality	1
much	1
less	1
the	1
creatures	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
respectively	1
belong	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
mightiest	1
elephant	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
terrier	1
to	1
leviathan	1
so	1
compared	1
with	1
leviathan	1
s	1
tail	1
his	1
trunk	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
stalk	1
of	1
a	1
lily	1
the	1
most	1
direful	1
blow	1
from	1
the	1
elephant	1
s	1
trunk	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
playful	1
tap	1
of	1
a	1
fan	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
measureless	1
crush	1
and	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
ponderous	1
flukes	1
which	1
in	1
repeated	1
instances	1
have	1
one	1
after	1
the	1

hurled	1
entire	1
boats	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
crews	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
an	1
indian	1
juggler	1
tosses	1
his	1
balls	1
	1
	1
though	1
all	1
comparison	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
general	1
bulk	1
between	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
elephant	1
is	1
preposterous	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
the	1
elephant	1
stands	1
in	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
that	1
a	1
dog	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
elephant	1
nevertheless	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
wanting	1
some	1
points	1
of	1
curious	1
similitude	1
among	1
these	1
is	1
the	1
spout	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
elephant	1
will	1
often	1
draw	1
up	1
water	1
or	1
dust	1
in	1
his	1
trunk	1
and	1
then	1
elevating	1
it	1
jet	1
it	1
forth	1
in	1
a	1
stream	1
	1
	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
consider	1
this	1
mighty	1
tail	1
the	1
more	1
do	1
i	1
deplore	1
my	1
inability	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
are	1
gestures	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
well	1
grace	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man	1
remain	1
wholly	1
inexplicable	1
in	1
an	1
extensive	1
herd	1
so	1
remarkable	1
occasionally	1
are	1
these	1
mystic	1
gestures	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
hunters	1
who	1
have	1
declared	1
them	1
akin	1
to	1
free	1
mason	1
signs	1
and	1
symbols	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
indeed	1
by	1
these	1
methods	1
intelligently	1
conversed	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
nor	1
are	1
there	1
wanting	1
other	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
general	1
body	1
full	1
of	1
strangeness	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
to	1
his	1
most	1
experienced	1
assailant	1

him	1
how	1
i	1
may	1
then	1
i	1
but	1
go	1
skin	1
deep	1
i	1
know	1
him	1
not	1

never	1
will	1

if	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
this	1

how	1
understand	1
his	1

a	1

was	1
descried	1
almost	1
renouncing	1
all	1
thought	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
any	1
game	1
hereabouts	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
well	1
nigh	1
entered	1
the	1

when	1
the	1
customary	1
cheering	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
aloft	1

ere	1
long	1
a	1
spectacle	1
of	1
singular	1
magnificence	1
saluted	1
us	1
	1

here	1
be	1
it	1
premised	1
that	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
unwearied	1
activity	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
hunted	1
over	1
all	1
four	1
oceans	1
the	1

extensive	1

sometimes	1
embracing	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
multitude	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
almost	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
numerous	1
nations	1
of	1

had	1
sworn	1
solemn	1
league	1

covenant	1
for	1
mutual	1
assistance	1

protection	1
to	1
this	1
aggregation	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1

into	1
such	1
immense	1
caravans	1
may	1
be	1
imputed	1
the	1
circumstance	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
cruising	1
grounds	1
you	1
may	1
now	1
sometimes	1
sail	1
for	1
weeks	1
and	1
months	1
together	1
without	1
being	1
greeted	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
spout	1
and	1
then	1
be	1
suddenly	1
saluted	1
by	1
what	1
sometimes	1
seems	1
thousands	1
on	1
thousands	1
	1
broad	1
on	1
both	1
bows	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
some	1
two	1

three	1

forming	1
a	1

one	1

a	1

this	1

hurrying	1
forward	1
through	1
the	1

gradually	1
contracting	1
the	1

piled	1

we	1

along	1

before	1
us	1
when	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
tashtego	1
was	1
heard	1
loudly	1
directing	1
attention	1
to	1
something	1
in	1
our	1
wake	1
	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
crescent	1
in	1
our	1
van	1
we	1
beheld	1
another	1
in	1
our	1

it	1
seemed	1
formed	1
of	1
detached	1
white	1
vapours	1
rising	1
and	1
falling	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
spouts	1
of	1
the	1

only	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
completely	1
come	1

disappearing	1

after	1
us	1
	1
as	1

too	1
long	1
lurking	1
behind	1
the	1
headlands	1
till	1
the	1
pequod	1
should	1
fairly	1
have	1
entered	1
the	1

these	1
rascally	1
asiatics	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
hot	1
pursuit	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
their	1
over	1
cautious	1
delay	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
swift	1
pequod	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
leading	1
wind	1
was	1
herself	1
in	1
hot	1
chase	1
how	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
these	1
tawny	1
philanthropists	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
speeding	1
her	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
chosen	1
pursuit	1
mere	1
riding	1
whips	1

rowels	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
with	1
glass	1
under	1
arm	1
ahab	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
paced	1
the	1
deck	1
in	1
his	1
forward	1

beholding	1
the	1
monsters	1
he	1
chased	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
after	1
one	1
the	1
bloodthirsty	1
pirates	1
chasing	1
him	1
some	1
such	1
fancy	1
as	1
the	1
above	1
seemed	1
his	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
watery	1
defile	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
then	1
sailing	1
and	1
bethought	1
him	1
that	1
through	1
that	1
gate	1
lay	1
the	1
route	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance	1
and	1
beheld	1
how	1
that	1
through	1
that	1
same	1
gate	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
both	1
chasing	1
and	1
being	1
chased	1
to	1
his	1
deadly	1
end	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
but	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
remorseless	1
wild	1
pirates	1
and	1
inhuman	1
atheistical	1
devils	1
were	1
infernally	1
cheering	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
their	1
curses	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
conceits	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
brain	1
ahab	1
s	1
brow	1
was	1
left	1
gaunt	1
and	1
ribbed	1
like	1
the	1
black	1
sand	1
beach	1
after	1
some	1
stormy	1
tide	1
has	1
been	1
gnawing	1
it	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
drag	1
the	1
firm	1
thing	1
from	1
its	1
place	1
	1
but	1
thoughts	1
like	1
these	1
troubled	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
reckless	1
crew	1
and	1
when	1
after	1
steadily	1
dropping	1
and	1
dropping	1
the	1
pirates	1
astern	1
the	1
pequod	1
at	1
last	1
shot	1
by	1
the	1
vivid	1
green	1
cockatoo	1
point	1
on	1
the	1
sumatra	1
side	1
emerging	1
at	1
last	1
upon	1
the	1
broad	1
waters	1
beyond	1
then	1
the	1
harpooneers	1
seemed	1
more	1
to	1
grieve	1
that	1
the	1
swift	1
whales	1
had	1
been	1
gaining	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
than	1
to	1
rejoice	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
so	1
victoriously	1
gained	1
upon	1
the	1
malays	1
but	1
still	1
driving	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
seemed	1
abating	1
their	1
speed	1
gradually	1
the	1
ship	1
neared	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
now	1
dying	1
away	1
word	1
was	1
passed	1
to	1
spring	1
to	1
the	1
boats	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
did	1
the	1
herd	1
by	1
some	1
presumed	1
wonderful	1
instinct	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
become	1
notified	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
keels	1
that	1
were	1
after	1
them	1
though	1
as	1
yet	1
a	1
mile	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
than	1
they	1
rallied	1
again	1
and	1
forming	1
in	1
close	1
ranks	1
and	1
battalions	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
spouts	1
all	1
looked	1
like	1
flashing	1
lines	1
of	1
stacked	1
bayonets	1
moved	1
on	1
with	1
redoubled	1
velocity	1
	1
stripped	1
to	1
our	1
shirts	1
and	1
drawers	1
we	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
white	1
ash	1
and	1
after	1
several	1
hours	1
pulling	1
were	1
almost	1
disposed	1
to	1
renounce	1
the	1
chase	1
when	1
a	1
general	1
pausing	1
commotion	1
among	1
the	1
whales	1
gave	1
animating	1
token	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
perplexity	1
of	1
inert	1
irresolution	1
which	1
when	1
the	1
fishermen	1
perceive	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
gallied	1
the	1
compact	1
martial	1
columns	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
hitherto	1
rapidly	1
and	1
steadily	1
swimming	1
were	1
now	1
broken	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
measureless	1
rout	1
and	1
like	1
king	1
porus	1
elephants	1
in	1
the	1
indian	1
battle	1
with	1
alexander	1
they	1
seemed	1
going	1
mad	1
with	1
consternation	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
expanding	1
in	1
vast	1
irregular	1
circles	1
and	1
aimlessly	1
swimming	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
by	1
their	1
short	1
thick	1
spoutings	1
they	1
plainly	1
betrayed	1
their	1
distraction	1
of	1
panic	1
this	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
strangely	1
evinced	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
who	1
completely	1
paralysed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
helplessly	1
floated	1
like	1
water	1
logged	1
dismantled	1
ships	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
had	1
these	1
leviathans	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
simple	1
sheep	1
pursued	1
over	1
the	1
pasture	1
by	1
three	1
fierce	1
wolves	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
evinced	1
such	1
excessive	1
dismay	1
but	1
this	1
occasional	1
timidity	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
herding	1
creatures	1
though	1
banding	1
together	1
in	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
the	1
lion	1
maned	1
buffaloes	1
of	1
the	1

too	1
all	1
human	1
beings	1
how	1
when	1
herded	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
sheepfold	1
of	1
a	1
theatre	1

at	1
the	1

any	1
amazement	1
at	1

no	1
folly	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
infinitely	1
outdone	1
by	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
men	1
	1
though	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
whales	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
were	1
in	1
violent	1
motion	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
the	1
herd	1
neither	1
advanced	1
nor	1
retreated	1
but	1
collectively	1
remained	1
in	1
one	1
place	1

is	1
customary	1
in	1
those	1
cases	1
the	1
boats	1
at	1
once	1

making	1
for	1
some	1
one	1

then	1
running	1
away	1
with	1

straight	1
for	1

no	1

it	1

one	1
of	1
the	1

power	1

speed	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1

in	1

in	1
a	1

striving	1

second	1
were	1
successfully	1
darted	1
and	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
whales	1
staggeringly	1
running	1
off	1
fettered	1
by	1
the	1
enormous	1
sidelong	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
towing	1
drugg	1
they	1
were	1
cramped	1
like	1
malefactors	1
with	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
ball	1
but	1
upon	1
flinging	1
the	1
third	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
tossing	1

wooden	1

caught	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1

in	1
an	1
instant	1
tore	1

out	1

carried	1
it	1
away	1
dropping	1
the	1
oarsman	1
in	1
the	1

on	1
both	1

the	1

came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
wounded	1
planks	1
but	1
we	1
stuffed	1
two	1

three	1
drawers	1

shirts	1
in	1

so	1
stopped	1
the	1

we	1
advanced	1
into	1
the	1

greatly	1
diminished	1
moreover	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
circumference	1
of	1
commotion	1
the	1
direful	1
disorders	1
seemed	1
waning	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
jerking	1
harpoon	1
drew	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
towing	1
whale	1
sideways	1
vanished	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
tapering	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
parting	1
momentum	1
we	1
glided	1
between	1
two	1
whales	1
into	1
the	1
innermost	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
shoal	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
some	1
mountain	1
torrent	1
we	1
had	1
slid	1
into	1
a	1
serene	1
valley	1
lake	1

the	1
storms	1
in	1
the	1
roaring	1

the	1
subtle	1
moisture	1
thrown	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
whale	1
in	1
his	1
more	1
quiet	1
moods	1
yes	1
we	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
that	1
enchanted	1
calm	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
lurks	1
at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
commotion	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
distracted	1
distance	1
we	1
beheld	1
the	1
tumults	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
concentric	1
circles	1
and	1
saw	1
successive	1
pods	1
of	1
whales	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
in	1
each	1
swiftly	1
going	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
like	1
multiplied	1
spans	1
of	1
horses	1
in	1
a	1
ring	1

so	1
closely	1

easily	1
have	1
over	1
arched	1
the	1

ones	1
and	1
so	1
have	1
gone	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
backs	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
density	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
reposing	1
whales	1

immediately	1
surrounding	1
the	1
embayed	1
axis	1
of	1

for	1
a	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
living	1

hemmed	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1

to	1
shut	1
us	1
up	1
keeping	1
at	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1

were	1
occasionally	1
visited	1
by	1
small	1

discovered	1
from	1
our	1

up	1
almost	1
from	1

as	1
if	1
the	1

them	1
from	1
learning	1
the	1

its	1

from	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1

evinced	1
a	1
wondrous	1
fearlessness	1

confidence	1

else	1
a	1
still	1

panic	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
marvel	1
at	1

the	1

the	1

to	1

wounded	1
as	1
we	1

in	1
this	1

not	1
effectually	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
had	1
broken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1

carrying	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
half	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
in	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
wound	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
dashing	1
among	1
the	1
revolving	1
circles	1
like	1
the	1
lone	1
mounted	1
desperado	1
arnold	1
at	1
the	1

of	1
saratoga	1
carrying	1
dismay	1
wherever	1
he	1
went	1
	1
but	1
agonizing	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
wound	1
of	1
this	1
whale	1
and	1
an	1
appalling	1
spectacle	1
enough	1
any	1
way	1
yet	1
the	1
peculiar	1
horror	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
a	1
cause	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
intervening	1
distance	1
obscured	1
from	1
us	1

at	1
length	1
we	1
perceived	1
that	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
unimaginable	1
accidents	1
of	1
the	1
fishery	1
this	1
whale	1
had	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
harpoon	1
line	1
that	1
he	1
towed	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
cutting	1
spade	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
free	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
attached	1
to	1
that	1
weapon	1
had	1
permanently	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
coils	1
of	1
the	1
harpoon	1
line	1
round	1
his	1
tail	1
the	1
cutting	1
spade	1
itself	1
had	1
worked	1
loose	1
from	1
his	1
flesh	1
so	1
that	1
tormented	1
to	1
madness	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
churning	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
violently	1
flailing	1
with	1
his	1
flexible	1
tail	1
and	1
tossing	1
the	1
keen	1
spade	1
about	1
him	1
wounding	1
and	1
murdering	1
his	1
own	1
comrades	1
	1
this	1
terrific	1
object	1
seemed	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
from	1
their	1
stationary	1
fright	1
first	1
the	1
whales	1
forming	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
our	1
lake	1
began	1
to	1
crowd	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
tumble	1
against	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
if	1
lifted	1
by	1
half	1
spent	1

from	1

began	1
faintly	1

more	1
contracting	1

the	1

in	1
the	1

a	1
low	1

when	1

great	1
river	1
hudson	1
breaks	1
up	1
in	1

the	1
entire	1

of	1

came	1
tumbling	1
upon	1

the	1

vast	1
black	1

leaving	1
a	1

by	1

at	1

earnestly	1

after	1
many	1
similar	1

we	1
at	1

crossed	1

itself	1

what	1

systematic	1
movement	1

renewed	1
their	1
onward	1
flight	1
with	1
augmented	1
fleetness	1
further	1
pursuit	1
was	1
useless	1
but	1
the	1
boats	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
their	1
wake	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
what	1
drugged	1

might	1
be	1
dropped	1
astern	1

likewise	1
to	1
secure	1

even	1
at	1

are	1
known	1
as	1

of	1
two	1

composed	1
almost	1

young	1
vigorous	1
males	1

bulls	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
familiarly	1
designated	1
	1
in	1
cavalier	1
attendance	1
upon	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
females	1
you	1
invariably	1
see	1
a	1
male	1
of	1
full	1
grown	1
magnitude	1
but	1
not	1
old	1
who	1
upon	1
any	1
alarm	1
evinces	1
his	1
gallantry	1
by	1
falling	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
and	1
covering	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
his	1
ladies	1
in	1
truth	1
this	1
gentleman	1
is	1
a	1
luxurious	1
ottoman	1
swimming	1
about	1
over	1
the	1
watery	1
world	1
surroundingly	1
accompanied	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
solaces	1
and	1
endearments	1
of	1
the	1
harem	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
this	1
ottoman	1
and	1
his	1
concubines	1
is	1
striking	1
because	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
leviathanic	1
proportions	1
the	1
ladies	1
even	1
at	1
full	1
growth	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
an	1
average	1
sized	1
male	1
they	1
are	1
comparatively	1
delicate	1
indeed	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
not	1
to	1
exceed	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
yards	1
round	1
the	1
waist	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
they	1
are	1
hereditarily	1
entitled	1
to	1
embonpoint	1
	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
curious	1
to	1
watch	1
this	1
harem	1
and	1
its	1
lord	1
in	1
their	1
indolent	1
ramblings	1
like	1
fashionables	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
ever	1
on	1

in	1
leisurely	1

of	1

you	1

them	1

for	1
the	1
full	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1

perhaps	1
from	1

the	1

so	1
cheating	1

of	1
all	1
unpleasant	1
weariness	1
and	1
warmth	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
have	1
lounged	1
up	1

down	1
the	1
promenade	1
of	1
the	1
equator	1
awhile	1
they	1
start	1
for	1
the	1
oriental	1
waters	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
cool	1
season	1
there	1

my	1

litigated	1
in	1

a	1

of	1
a	1

in	1

they	1
were	1
at	1

through	1
peril	1
of	1

lives	1
obliged	1
to	1
forsake	1
not	1
only	1
their	1
lines	1
but	1
their	1
boat	1
itself	1
ultimately	1
the	1
defendants	1
the	1
crew	1
of	1
another	1

came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1

finally	1

before	1
the	1

when	1
those	1
defendants	1
were	1
remonstrated	1
with	1
their	1
captain	1
snapped	1
his	1
fingers	1
in	1
the	1

had	1
remained	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
seizure	1
wherefore	1
the	1
plaintiffs	1
now	1
sued	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1

value	1
of	1

was	1
the	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
defence	1
the	1
witty	1
erskine	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
position	1
by	1
alluding	1
to	1
a	1
recent	1
crim	1
con	1
case	1
wherein	1
a	1
gentleman	1
after	1
in	1
vain	1
trying	1
to	1
bridle	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
viciousness	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
abandoned	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
seas	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
years	1
repenting	1
of	1
that	1
step	1
he	1
instituted	1
an	1
action	1
to	1
recover	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
erskine	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
he	1
then	1
supported	1
it	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
gentleman	1
had	1
originally	1
harpooned	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
her	1
fast	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
stress	1
of	1
her	1
plunging	1
viciousness	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
abandoned	1
her	1
yet	1
abandon	1
her	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
became	1
a	1
loose	1
fish	1
and	1
therefore	1
when	1
a	1
subsequent	1
gentleman	1
re	1
harpooned	1
her	1
the	1
lady	1
then	1
became	1
that	1
subsequent	1
gentleman	1
s	1
property	1
along	1
with	1
whatever	1
harpoon	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
sticking	1
in	1
her	1
	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
erskine	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
were	1
reciprocally	1
illustrative	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
	1
these	1
pleadings	1
and	1
the	1
counter	1
pleadings	1
being	1
duly	1
heard	1
the	1
very	1
learned	1
judge	1
in	1
set	1
terms	1
decided	1
to	1
wit	1
that	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
boat	1
he	1
awarded	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
plaintiffs	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
merely	1
abandoned	1

they	1
belonged	1
to	1

the	1

because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
loose	1

at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
capture	1
and	1
the	1

because	1
when	1
the	1
fish	1
made	1
off	1
with	1
them	1
it	1
the	1
fish	1
acquired	1
a	1
property	1
in	1
those	1
articles	1
and	1
hence	1
anybody	1
who	1
afterwards	1
took	1
the	1

had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
them	1
now	1
the	1

the	1

fact	1
that	1
the	1

is	1
still	1
in	1

i	1
proceed	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
happened	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years	1
	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
some	1
honest	1
mariners	1
of	1
dover	1
or	1
sandwich	1
or	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cinque	1

had	1
after	1
a	1
hard	1
chase	1
succeeded	1
in	1
killing	1
and	1
beaching	1
a	1
fine	1
whale	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
originally	1
descried	1
afar	1
off	1
from	1
the	1

now	1
the	1

are	1
partially	1

somehow	1
under	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1

a	1
sort	1
of	1
policeman	1

called	1
a	1
lord	1

holding	1
the	1
office	1
directly	1
from	1

i	1
believe	1
all	1
the	1

the	1

become	1
by	1

by	1
some	1

this	1
office	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
sinecure	1

not	1
so	1
because	1
the	1

busily	1

in	1
fobbing	1
his	1
perquisites	1

by	1

his	1

the	1

the	1

that	1
viewed	1
in	1

the	1

in	1

under	1

circumstances	1
a	1
rather	1
hard	1
one	1
an	1
honest	1
clergyman	1
of	1

respectfully	1
addressed	1

note	1

him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
those	1
unfortunate	1
mariners	1
into	1
full	1
consideration	1
to	1
which	1
my	1
lord	1
duke	1
in	1
substance	1
replied	1
both	1
letters	1
were	1
published	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
so	1

received	1
the	1
money	1

would	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
the	1

for	1

he	1
the	1

would	1
decline	1
meddling	1
with	1
other	1
people	1

this	1
the	1
still	1
militant	1
old	1
man	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
kingdoms	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
coercing	1
alms	1
of	1
beggars	1
	1
it	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
alleged	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
a	1
delegated	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
sovereign	1
we	1
must	1
needs	1
inquire	1
then	1
on	1
what	1
principle	1
the	1
sovereign	1
is	1
originally	1
invested	1
with	1
that	1
right	1
the	1
law	1
itself	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
set	1
forth	1
but	1
plowdon	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
it	1
says	1
plowdon	1
the	1
whale	1
so	1
caught	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
queen	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
superior	1
excellence	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
soundest	1
commentators	1
this	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
held	1
a	1
cogent	1
argument	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
king	1
have	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
the	1
tail	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
that	1
ye	1
lawyers	1
	1
in	1
his	1
treatise	1
on	1
queen	1
gold	1
or	1
queen	1

that	1
ye	1
queen	1
s	1
wardrobe	1
may	1
be	1
supplied	1
with	1
ye	1
whalebone	1
now	1
this	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
black	1
limber	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
greenland	1
or	1
right	1
whale	1
was	1
largely	1
used	1
in	1
ladies	1
bodices	1
but	1
this	1
same	1
bone	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
tail	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
sad	1
mistake	1
for	1
a	1
sagacious	1
lawyer	1
like	1
prynne	1
but	1
is	1
the	1
queen	1
a	1

be	1

to	1

that	1

way	1

the	1

the	1
highly	1
dense	1
and	1
elastic	1
head	1
peculiar	1
to	1
that	1
fish	1
which	1
symbolically	1
regarded	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
humorously	1
grounded	1
upon	1
some	1
presumed	1
congeniality	1

thus	1
there	1
seems	1

when	1

over	1

mid	1

are	1
some	1
of	1

whales	1
we	1
tickled	1
the	1

would	1
keel	1
up	1
before	1

	1
presently	1
the	1
vapours	1
in	1
advance	1
slid	1
aside	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
lay	1
a	1
ship	1
whose	1
furled	1
sails	1
betokened	1
that	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
whale	1
must	1
be	1
alongside	1
as	1
we	1
glided	1
nearer	1
the	1
stranger	1
showed	1
french	1

from	1
his	1
peak	1

by	1

of	1

fowl	1
that	1
circled	1
and	1
hovered	1
and	1
swooped	1
around	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
whale	1
alongside	1
must	1
be	1
what	1
the	1
fishermen	1
call	1
a	1
blasted	1
whale	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
whale	1
that	1
has	1
died	1
unmolested	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
so	1
floated	1
an	1
unappropriated	1
corpse	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
conceived	1
what	1
an	1
unsavory	1
odor	1
such	1
a	1
mass	1
must	1
exhale	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
assyrian	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
are	1
incompetent	1
to	1
bury	1
the	1
departed	1
so	1
intolerable	1
indeed	1
is	1
it	1
regarded	1
by	1
some	1
that	1
no	1
cupidity	1
could	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
moor	1
alongside	1
of	1
it	1
yet	1
are	1
there	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
still	1
do	1
it	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
oil	1
obtained	1
from	1
such	1
subjects	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
inferior	1
quality	1

no	1

of	1
attar	1
of	1
rose	1
	1
coming	1
still	1
nearer	1
with	1
the	1
expiring	1
breeze	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
frenchman	1
had	1
a	1
second	1
whale	1
alongside	1
and	1
this	1
second	1
whale	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
nosegay	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
truth	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
problematical	1
whales	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
dry	1
up	1
and	1
die	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
prodigious	1
dyspepsia	1
or	1
indigestion	1
leaving	1
their	1
defunct	1
bodies	1
almost	1
entirely	1
bankrupt	1
of	1
anything	1
like	1
oil	1
nevertheless	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
place	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
knowing	1
fisherman	1
will	1
ever	1
turn	1
up	1
his	1
nose	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
whale	1
as	1
this	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
may	1
shun	1
blasted	1
whales	1
in	1
general	1
	1
the	1

now	1
swept	1
so	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1

recognised	1
his	1
cutting	1

pole	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
that	1
were	1
knotted	1
round	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1

of	1
these	1
whales	1
	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
pretty	1
fellow	1
now	1

banteringly	1
laughed	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
bows	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
jackal	1
for	1
ye	1
i	1
well	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
crappoes	1
of	1
frenchmen	1
are	1
but	1
poor	1
devils	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
sometimes	1
lowering	1
their	1
boats	1
for	1
breakers	1
mistaking	1
them	1
for	1
sperm	1
whale	1
spouts	1
yes	1
and	1
sometimes	1
sailing	1
from	1
their	1
port	1
with	1
their	1
hold	1
full	1
of	1
boxes	1
of	1
tallow	1
candles	1
and	1
cases	1
of	1
snuffers	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
oil	1
they	1
will	1
get	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
dip	1
the	1
captain	1
s	1
wick	1
into	1
aye	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
but	1
look	1
ye	1
here	1
s	1
a	1
crappo	1
that	1
is	1
content	1
with	1
our	1
leavings	1
the	1
drugged	1
whale	1
there	1
i	1
mean	1
aye	1
and	1
is	1
content	1
too	1
with	1
scraping	1
the	1
dry	1
bones	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
precious	1
fish	1
he	1
has	1
there	1
poor	1
devil	1
i	1
say	1
pass	1
round	1
a	1
hat	1
some	1
one	1
and	1
let	1
s	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
oil	1
for	1
dear	1
charity	1
s	1
sake	1
for	1
what	1
oil	1
he	1
ll	1
get	1
from	1
that	1
drugged	1
whale	1
there	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
burn	1
in	1
a	1
jail	1
no	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condemned	1
cell	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
whale	1
why	1
i	1
ll	1
agree	1
to	1
get	1
more	1
oil	1
by	1
chopping	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
out	1
these	1
three	1
masts	1
of	1
ours	1
than	1
he	1
ll	1
get	1
from	1
that	1
bundle	1
of	1
bones	1
though	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
may	1
contain	1
something	1
worth	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
oil	1
yes	1
ambergris	1
i	1
wonder	1
now	1
if	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
worth	1
trying	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
faint	1
air	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
complete	1
calm	1
so	1
that	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
pequod	1
was	1
now	1
fairly	1
entrapped	1
in	1
the	1
smell	1
with	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
escaping	1
except	1
by	1
its	1
breezing	1
up	1
again	1
issuing	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
stubb	1
now	1
called	1
his	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
and	1
pulled	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
drawing	1
across	1
her	1
bow	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
fanciful	1
french	1
taste	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
stem	1
piece	1
was	1
carved	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
huge	1
drooping	1
stalk	1
was	1
painted	1
green	1
and	1
for	1
thorns	1
had	1
copper	1
spikes	1
projecting	1
from	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
whole	1
terminating	1
in	1
a	1
symmetrical	1
folded	1
bulb	1
of	1
a	1
bright	1
red	1
colour	1
upon	1
her	1
head	1
boards	1
in	1
large	1
gilt	1
letters	1
he	1
read	1
bouton	1
de	1
rose	1
rose	1
button	1
or	1
rose	1
bud	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
romantic	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
aromatic	1
ship	1
	1
though	1
stubb	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
bouton	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inscription	1
yet	1
the	1
word	1
rose	1
and	1
the	1
bulbous	1
figure	1
head	1
put	1
together	1
sufficiently	1
explained	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
him	1
	1
a	1
wooden	1
rose	1
bud	1
eh	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
how	1
like	1
all	1
creation	1
it	1
smells	1
	1
now	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
hold	1
direct	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
deck	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pull	1
round	1
the	1
bows	1
to	1
the	1
starboard	1
side	1
and	1
thus	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
blasted	1
whale	1
and	1
so	1
talk	1
over	1
it	1
	1
arrived	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
spot	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
still	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
he	1
bawled	1
bouton	1
de	1
rose	1
ahoy	1

there	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
bouton	1
de	1
roses	1

rejoined	1
a	1
guernsey	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
who	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
the	1

	1
well	1
then	1

a	1
minute	1
	1
then	1
rapidly	1
pulling	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
pequod	1
and	1
seeing	1
ahab	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
quarter	1
deck	1
rail	1
awaiting	1
his	1
report	1
he	1
moulded	1
his	1
two	1
hands	1
into	1
a	1
trumpet	1
and	1
shouted	1
no	1
sir	1
no	1
upon	1
which	1
ahab	1
retired	1
and	1
stubb	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
frenchman	1
	1
he	1
now	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
chains	1
and	1
was	1
using	1
a	1
cutting	1
spade	1

slung	1
his	1

in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1

	1
what	1

broken	1
or	1
that	1

didn	1
t	1

any	1

answered	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
relish	1
the	1
job	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
very	1
much	1
but	1
what	1

the	1
guernseyman	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
sudden	1
passion	1
	1
oh	1

cool	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
word	1
why	1

	1
anything	1

oblige	1
ye	1
my	1
sweet	1

pleasant	1
fellow	1
rejoined	1
stubb	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
soon	1
mounted	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
there	1
a	1
queer	1
scene	1
presented	1
itself	1
the	1
sailors	1
in	1
tasselled	1
caps	1
of	1
red	1
worsted	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
heavy	1
tackles	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
whales	1
but	1
they	1
worked	1
rather	1
slow	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
fast	1
and	1
seemed	1
in	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
humor	1
all	1
their	1
noses	1
upwardly	1
projected	1
from	1
their	1
faces	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
jib	1
booms	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
pairs	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
drop	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mast	1
head	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
fresh	1
air	1
some	1
thinking	1
they	1
would	1
catch	1
the	1
plague	1
dipped	1
oakum	1
in	1
coal	1
tar	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
held	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
nostrils	1
others	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
stems	1
of	1
their	1
pipes	1
almost	1
short	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
bowl	1
were	1
vigorously	1
puffing	1
tobacco	1
smoke	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
constantly	1
filled	1
their	1
olfactories	1
	1
stubb	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
outcries	1
and	1
anathemas	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
captain	1
s	1
round	1
house	1
abaft	1
and	1
looking	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
saw	1
a	1
fiery	1
face	1
thrust	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
was	1
held	1
ajar	1
from	1
within	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
tormented	1
surgeon	1
who	1
after	1
in	1
vain	1
remonstrating	1
against	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
had	1
betaken	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
s	1
round	1
house	1
cabinet	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
pest	1
but	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
yelling	1
out	1
his	1
entreaties	1
and	1
indignations	1
at	1
times	1
	1
marking	1
all	1
this	1
stubb	1
argued	1
well	1
for	1
his	1
scheme	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
chat	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
mate	1
expressed	1
his	1
detestation	1
of	1
his	1
captain	1
as	1
a	1
conceited	1
ignoramus	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
so	1
unsavory	1
and	1
unprofitable	1
a	1
pickle	1
sounding	1
him	1
carefully	1
stubb	1
further	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
suspicion	1
concerning	1
the	1
ambergris	1
he	1
therefore	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
but	1
otherwise	1
was	1
quite	1
frank	1
and	1
confidential	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
quickly	1
concocted	1
a	1
little	1
plan	1
for	1
both	1
circumventing	1
and	1
satirizing	1
the	1
captain	1
without	1
his	1
at	1
all	1
dreaming	1
of	1
distrusting	1
their	1
sincerity	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
plan	1
of	1
theirs	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
an	1
interpreter	1
s	1
office	1
was	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
captain	1
what	1
he	1
pleased	1
but	1
as	1
coming	1
from	1
stubb	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
stubb	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
utter	1
any	1
nonsense	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
uppermost	1
in	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
interview	1
	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
their	1
destined	1
victim	1
appeared	1
from	1
his	1
cabin	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
dark	1
but	1
rather	1
delicate	1
looking	1
man	1
for	1
a	1
sea	1
captain	1
with	1
large	1
whiskers	1
and	1
moustache	1
however	1
and	1
wore	1
a	1
red	1
cotton	1
velvet	1
vest	1
with	1
watch	1
seals	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
stubb	1
was	1
now	1
politely	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
ostentatiously	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
interpreting	1
between	1
them	1
	1
what	1
shall	1
i	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
first	1
said	1
he	1
	1
why	1
said	1
stubb	1
eyeing	1
the	1
velvet	1
vest	1
and	1
the	1
watch	1
and	1
seals	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
begin	1
by	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
looks	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
babyish	1
to	1
me	1
though	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
	1
he	1
says	1
monsieur	1
said	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
in	1
french	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
captain	1
that	1
only	1
yesterday	1
his	1
ship	1
spoke	1
a	1
vessel	1
whose	1
captain	1
and	1
chief	1
mate	1
with	1
six	1
sailors	1
had	1
all	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
caught	1
from	1
a	1
blasted	1
whale	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
alongside	1
	1
upon	1
this	1
the	1
captain	1
started	1
and	1
eagerly	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
	1
what	1
now	1
said	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
to	1
stubb	1
	1
why	1
since	1
he	1
takes	1
it	1
so	1
easy	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
now	1
i	1
have	1
eyed	1
him	1
carefully	1
i	1
m	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
no	1
more	1
fit	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
whale	1
ship	1
than	1
a	1
st	1
jago	1
monkey	1
in	1
fact	1
tell	1
him	1
from	1
me	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
baboon	1
	1
he	1
vows	1
and	1
declares	1
monsieur	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
whale	1
the	1
dried	1
one	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
deadly	1
than	1
the	1
blasted	1
one	1
in	1
fine	1
monsieur	1
he	1
conjures	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
value	1
our	1
lives	1
to	1
cut	1
loose	1
from	1
these	1
fish	1
	1
instantly	1
the	1
captain	1
ran	1
forward	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
commanded	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
desist	1
from	1
hoisting	1
the	1
cutting	1
tackles	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
cast	1
loose	1
the	1
cables	1
and	1
chains	1
confining	1
the	1
whales	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
	1
what	1
now	1
said	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
when	1
the	1
captain	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
them	1
	1
why	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
yes	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
him	1
now	1
that	1
that	1
in	1
fact	1
tell	1
him	1
i	1
ve	1
diddled	1
him	1
and	1
aside	1
to	1
himself	1
perhaps	1
somebody	1
else	1
	1
he	1
says	1
monsieur	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
us	1
	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
captain	1
vowed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
grateful	1
parties	1
meaning	1
himself	1
and	1
mate	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
inviting	1
stubb	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
cabin	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
bordeaux	1
	1
he	1
wants	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
interpreter	1
	1
thank	1
him	1
heartily	1
but	1
tell	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
against	1
my	1
principles	1
to	1
drink	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
i	1
ve	1
diddled	1
in	1
fact	1
tell	1
him	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
	1
he	1
says	1
monsieur	1
that	1
his	1
principles	1
won	1
t	1
admit	1
of	1
his	1
drinking	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
monsieur	1
wants	1
to	1
live	1
another	1
day	1
to	1
drink	1
then	1
monsieur	1
had	1
best	1
drop	1
all	1
four	1
boats	1
and	1
pull	1
the	1
ship	1
away	1
from	1
these	1
whales	1
for	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
calm	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
drift	1
	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
stubb	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
getting	1
into	1
his	1
boat	1
hailed	1
the	1
guernsey	1
man	1
to	1
this	1
effect	1
that	1
having	1
a	1
long	1
tow	1
line	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
by	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
lighter	1
whale	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
while	1
the	1
frenchman	1
s	1
boats	1
then	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
towing	1
the	1
ship	1
one	1
way	1
stubb	1
benevolently	1
towed	1
away	1
at	1
his	1
whale	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
ostentatiously	1
slacking	1
out	1
a	1
most	1
unusually	1
long	1
tow	1
line	1
	1
presently	1
a	1
breeze	1
sprang	1
up	1
stubb	1
feigned	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
hoisting	1
his	1
boats	1
the	1
frenchman	1
soon	1
increased	1
his	1
distance	1
while	1
the	1
pequod	1
slid	1
in	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
stubb	1
s	1
whale	1
whereupon	1
stubb	1
quickly	1
pulled	1
to	1
the	1
floating	1
body	1
and	1
hailing	1
the	1
pequod	1
to	1
give	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
intentions	1
at	1
once	1
proceeded	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
unrighteous	1
cunning	1
seizing	1
his	1
sharp	1
boat	1
spade	1
he	1
commenced	1
an	1
excavation	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
side	1
fin	1
you	1
would	1
almost	1
have	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
digging	1
a	1
cellar	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
his	1
spade	1
struck	1
against	1
the	1
gaunt	1
ribs	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
turning	1
up	1
old	1
roman	1
tiles	1
and	1
pottery	1
buried	1
in	1
fat	1
english	1
loam	1
his	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
high	1
excitement	1
eagerly	1
helping	1
their	1
chief	1
and	1
looking	1
as	1
anxious	1
as	1
gold	1
hunters	1
	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
numberless	1
fowls	1
were	1
diving	1
and	1
ducking	1
and	1
screaming	1
and	1
yelling	1
and	1
fighting	1
around	1
them	1
stubb	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
disappointed	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
horrible	1
nosegay	1
increased	1
when	1
suddenly	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
plague	1
there	1
stole	1
a	1
faint	1
stream	1
of	1
perfume	1
which	1
flowed	1
through	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
bad	1
smells	1
without	1
being	1
absorbed	1
by	1
it	1
as	1
one	1
river	1
will	1
flow	1
into	1
and	1
then	1
along	1
with	1
another	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
blending	1
with	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
	1
i	1
have	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
it	1
cried	1
stubb	1
with	1
delight	1
striking	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
subterranean	1
regions	1
a	1
purse	1
a	1
purse	1
	1
dropping	1
his	1
spade	1
he	1
thrust	1
both	1
hands	1
in	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
handfuls	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
ripe	1
windsor	1
soap	1
or	1
rich	1
mottled	1
old	1
cheese	1
very	1
unctuous	1
and	1
savory	1
withal	1
you	1
might	1
easily	1
dent	1
it	1
with	1
your	1
thumb	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
hue	1
between	1
yellow	1
and	1
ash	1
colour	1
and	1
this	1
good	1
friends	1
is	1
ambergris	1
worth	1
a	1
gold	1
guinea	1
an	1
ounce	1
to	1
any	1
druggist	1
some	1
six	1
handfuls	1
were	1
obtained	1
but	1
more	1
was	1
unavoidably	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
perhaps	1
might	1

been	1
secured	1

ambergris	1
	1
	1
now	1
this	1
ambergris	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
substance	1
and	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
commerce	1
that	1
in	1
1791	1
a	1
certain	1
nantucket	1
born	1
captain	1
coffin	1
was	1
examined	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
english	1
house	1
of	1
commons	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
indeed	1
until	1
a	1
comparatively	1
late	1
day	1
the	1
precise	1
origin	1
of	1
ambergris	1
remained	1
like	1
amber	1
itself	1
a	1
problem	1
to	1
the	1
learned	1
though	1
the	1
word	1
ambergris	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
french	1
compound	1
for	1
grey	1
amber	1
yet	1
the	1
two	1
substances	1
are	1
quite	1
distinct	1
for	1
amber	1
though	1
at	1
times	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
is	1
also	1
dug	1
up	1
in	1
some	1
far	1
inland	1
soils	1
whereas	1
ambergris	1
is	1
never	1
found	1
except	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
besides	1
amber	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
transparent	1
brittle	1
odorless	1
substance	1
used	1
for	1
mouth	1
pieces	1
to	1
pipes	1
for	1
beads	1
and	1
ornaments	1
but	1
ambergris	1
is	1
soft	1
waxy	1
and	1
so	1
highly	1
fragrant	1
and	1
spicy	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
largely	1
used	1
in	1
perfumery	1
in	1
pastiles	1
precious	1
candles	1
hair	1
powders	1
and	1
pomatum	1
the	1
turks	1
use	1
it	1
in	1
cooking	1
and	1
also	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
mecca	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose	1
that	1
frankincense	1
is	1
carried	1
to	1
st	1
peter	1
s	1
in	1
rome	1
some	1
wine	1
merchants	1
drop	1
a	1
few	1
grains	1
into	1
claret	1
to	1
flavor	1
it	1
	1
who	1
would	1
think	1
then	1
that	1
such	1
fine	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
should	1
regale	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
essence	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
inglorious	1
bowels	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
whale	1
yet	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
some	1
ambergris	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
and	1
by	1
others	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
dyspepsia	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
how	1
to	1
cure	1
such	1
a	1
dyspepsia	1
it	1
were	1
hard	1
to	1
say	1
unless	1
by	1
administering	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
boat	1
loads	1
of	1
brandreth	1
s	1
pills	1
and	1
then	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
harm	1
s	1
way	1
as	1
laborers	1
do	1
in	1
blasting	1
rocks	1
	1
i	1
have	1
forgotten	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
this	1
ambergris	1
certain	1
hard	1
round	1
bony	1
plates	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
stubb	1
thought	1
might	1
be	1
sailors	1
trowsers	1
buttons	1
but	1
it	1
afterwards	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
pieces	1
of	1
small	1
squid	1
bones	1
embalmed	1
in	1
that	1
manner	1
	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
incorruption	1
of	1
this	1
most	1
fragrant	1
ambergris	1
should	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
decay	1
is	1
this	1
nothing	1
bethink	1
thee	1
of	1
that	1
saying	1
of	1
st	1
paul	1
in	1
corinthians	1
about	1
corruption	1
and	1
incorruption	1
how	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour	1
but	1
raised	1
in	1
glory	1
and	1
likewise	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
that	1
saying	1
of	1
paracelsus	1
about	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
best	1
musk	1
also	1
forget	1
not	1
the	1
strange	1
fact	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
ill	1
savor	1
cologne	1
water	1
in	1
its	1
rudimental	1
manufacturing	1
stages	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
chapter	1
with	1
the	1
above	1
appeal	1
but	1
cannot	1
owing	1
to	1
my	1
anxiety	1
to	1
repel	1
a	1
charge	1
often	1
made	1
against	1
whalemen	1
and	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
some	1
already	1
biased	1
minds	1
might	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
indirectly	1
substantiated	1
by	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
frenchman	1
s	1
two	1
whales	1
elsewhere	1
in	1
this	1
volume	1
the	1
slanderous	1
aspersion	1
has	1
been	1
disproved	1
that	1
the	1
vocation	1
of	1
whaling	1
is	1
throughout	1
a	1
slatternly	1
untidy	1
business	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
thing	1
to	1
rebut	1
they	1
hint	1
that	1
all	1
whales	1
always	1
smell	1
bad	1
now	1
how	1
did	1
this	1
odious	1
stigma	1
originate	1
	1
i	1
opine	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
plainly	1
traceable	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
greenland	1
whaling	1
ships	1
in	1
london	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
centuries	1
ago	1
because	1
those	1
whalemen	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
now	1
try	1
out	1
their	1
oil	1
at	1
sea	1
as	1
the	1
southern	1
ships	1
have	1
always	1
done	1
but	1
cutting	1
up	1
the	1
fresh	1
blubber	1
in	1
small	1
bits	1
thrust	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
bung	1
holes	1
of	1
large	1

carry	1
it	1

in	1
that	1
manner	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1
those	1

the	1

to	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
exposed	1
forbidding	1
any	1

the	1

is	1
that	1
upon	1
breaking	1
into	1

one	1
of	1
these	1

in	1
the	1

a	1
savor	1
is	1
given	1
forth	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
arising	1
from	1
excavating	1
an	1

for	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
a	1
lying	1
in	1

	1
i	1
partly	1
surmise	1
also	1
that	1
this	1
wicked	1
charge	1
against	1
whalers	1
may	1
be	1
likewise	1
imputed	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
greenland	1
in	1
former	1
times	1
of	1
a	1
dutch	1
village	1
called	1
schmerenburgh	1
or	1
smeerenberg	1
which	1
latter	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
learned	1
fogo	1
von	1
slack	1
in	1

great	1

to	1
put	1
up	1
this	1
village	1
was	1
founded	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
afford	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
blubber	1
of	1
the	1
dutch	1
whale	1
fleet	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
out	1
without	1
being	1
taken	1
home	1
to	1
holland	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
furnaces	1
fat	1
kettles	1
and	1
oil	1
sheds	1
and	1
when	1
the	1

were	1

certainly	1
gave	1
forth	1
no	1
very	1
pleasant	1

all	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
different	1
with	1
a	1
south	1

which	1
in	1
a	1

four	1

fifty	1

in	1
the	1
state	1
that	1
it	1

the	1

nearly	1
scentless	1
the	1

is	1
that	1
living	1

dead	1
if	1

decently	1
treated	1
whales	1
as	1
a	1
species	1
are	1
by	1
no	1

creatures	1
of	1
ill	1

the	1

lights	1

up	1
not	1

let	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ambergris	1
affair	1
stubb	1
s	1
after	1
oarsman	1
chanced	1
so	1
to	1
sprain	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
become	1
quite	1
maimed	1
and	1
temporarily	1
pip	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
place	1
	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
stubb	1
lowered	1
with	1
him	1
pip	1
evinced	1
much	1
nervousness	1
but	1
happily	1
for	1
that	1
time	1
escaped	1
close	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
therefore	1
came	1
off	1
not	1
altogether	1
discreditably	1
though	1
stubb	1
observing	1
him	1
took	1
care	1
afterwards	1
to	1
exhort	1
him	1
to	1
cherish	1
his	1
courageousness	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
for	1
he	1
might	1
often	1
find	1
it	1
needful	1
	1
now	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
lowering	1
the	1
boat	1
paddled	1
upon	1
the	1
whale	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
fish	1
received	1
the	1
darted	1
iron	1
it	1
gave	1
its	1
customary	1
rap	1
which	1
happened	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
under	1
poor	1
pip	1
s	1
seat	1
the	1
involuntary	1
consternation	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
leap	1
paddle	1
in	1
hand	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
slack	1
whale	1
line	1
coming	1
against	1
his	1
chest	1
he	1
breasted	1
it	1
overboard	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
it	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
plumping	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
started	1
on	1
a	1
fierce	1
run	1
the	1
line	1
swiftly	1
straightened	1
and	1
presto	1
poor	1
pip	1
came	1
all	1
foaming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chocks	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
remorselessly	1
dragged	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
several	1
turns	1
around	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
neck	1
	1
tashtego	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
hunt	1
he	1
hated	1
pip	1
for	1
a	1
poltroon	1
snatching	1
the	1
boat	1
knife	1
from	1
its	1
sheath	1
he	1
suspended	1
its	1
sharp	1
edge	1
over	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
turning	1
towards	1
stubb	1
exclaimed	1
interrogatively	1
cut	1
meantime	1
pip	1
s	1
blue	1
choked	1
face	1
plainly	1
looked	1
do	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
all	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
flash	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
this	1
entire	1
thing	1
happened	1
	1
damn	1
him	1
cut	1
roared	1
stubb	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
whale	1
was	1
lost	1
and	1
pip	1
was	1
saved	1
	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
recovered	1
himself	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
negro	1
was	1
assailed	1
by	1
yells	1
and	1
execrations	1
from	1
the	1
crew	1
tranquilly	1
permitting	1
these	1
irregular	1
cursings	1
to	1
evaporate	1
stubb	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
plain	1
business	1
like	1
but	1
still	1
half	1
humorous	1
manner	1
cursed	1
pip	1
officially	1
and	1
that	1
done	1
unofficially	1
gave	1
him	1
much	1
wholesome	1
advice	1
the	1
substance	1
was	1
never	1
jump	1
from	1
a	1
boat	1
pip	1
except	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
indefinite	1
as	1
the	1
soundest	1
advice	1
ever	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
general	1
stick	1
to	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
your	1
true	1
motto	1
in	1
whaling	1
but	1
cases	1
will	1
sometimes	1
happen	1
when	1
leap	1
from	1
the	1
boat	1
is	1
still	1
better	1
moreover	1
as	1
if	1
perceiving	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
undiluted	1
conscientious	1
advice	1
to	1
pip	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
leaving	1
him	1
too	1
wide	1
a	1
margin	1
to	1
jump	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
stubb	1
suddenly	1
dropped	1
all	1
advice	1
and	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
command	1
stick	1
to	1
the	1
boat	1
pip	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
lord	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
pick	1
you	1
up	1
if	1
you	1
jump	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
afford	1
to	1
lose	1
whales	1
by	1
the	1
likes	1
of	1
you	1
a	1
whale	1
would	1
sell	1
for	1
thirty	1
times	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
pip	1
in	1
alabama	1
bear	1
that	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
jump	1
any	1
more	1
hereby	1
perhaps	1
stubb	1
indirectly	1
hinted	1
that	1
though	1
man	1
loved	1
his	1
fellow	1
yet	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
money	1
making	1
animal	1
which	1
propensity	1
too	1
often	1
interferes	1
with	1
his	1
benevolence	1
	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
and	1
pip	1
jumped	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
under	1
very	1
similar	1
circumstances	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
performance	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
breast	1
out	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
hence	1
when	1
the	1
whale	1
started	1
to	1
run	1
pip	1
was	1
left	1
behind	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
a	1
hurried	1
traveller	1
s	1
trunk	1
alas	1
stubb	1
was	1
but	1
too	1
true	1
to	1
his	1
word	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
beautiful	1
bounteous	1
blue	1
day	1
the	1
spangled	1
sea	1
calm	1
and	1

there	1

there	1
rolling	1
about	1
in	1

was	1
our	1

to	1
squeeze	1
these	1

into	1

a	1
sweet	1

unctuous	1
duty	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
in	1

this	1

was	1
such	1
a	1

having	1
my	1

in	1
it	1
for	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
my	1

felt	1
like	1

it	1
were	1
to	1
serpentine	1

spiralise	1
	1
as	1
i	1
sat	1
there	1
at	1

on	1

the	1

under	1
indolent	1

gliding	1
so	1
serenely	1

bathed	1
my	1

among	1
those	1
soft	1
gentle	1
globules	1
of	1
infiltrated	1
tissues	1
woven	1
almost	1
within	1
the	1
hour	1
as	1
they	1
richly	1
broke	1
to	1
my	1

and	1
discharged	1
all	1
their	1
opulence	1
like	1
fully	1
ripe	1
grapes	1

as	1
i	1
snuffed	1
up	1
that	1
uncontaminated	1

to	1
you	1
that	1
for	1
the	1

i	1
lived	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
musky	1

i	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
our	1
horrible	1
oath	1
in	1
that	1
inexpressible	1
sperm	1
i	1
washed	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
almost	1
began	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
old	1
paracelsan	1
superstition	1
that	1
sperm	1
is	1
of	1
rare	1
virtue	1
in	1
allaying	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
anger	1
while	1
bathing	1
in	1

i	1
felt	1
divinely	1
free	1

myself	1
almost	1
melted	1

squeezed	1
that	1
sperm	1
till	1
a	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
insanity	1
came	1
over	1
me	1

i	1
found	1
myself	1
unwittingly	1
squeezing	1
my	1
co	1

in	1
it	1
mistaking	1
their	1

for	1
the	1

an	1
abounding	1

continually	1
squeezing	1

ever	1
for	1
now	1
since	1
by	1
many	1
prolonged	1
repeated	1
experiences	1

have	1
perceived	1
that	1
in	1

must	1
eventually	1
lower	1

at	1

shift	1
his	1

not	1

which	1
i	1

it	1
to	1

it	1
is	1
called	1
slobgollion	1
an	1
appellation	1
original	1

the	1
nature	1

an	1
ineffably	1
oozy	1
stringy	1
affair	1

in	1
the	1

of	1

after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
squeezing	1

subsequent	1
decanting	1

wondrously	1
thin	1
ruptured	1

of	1
the	1

coalescing	1
	1
gurry	1
so	1
called	1
is	1
a	1
term	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
right	1
whalemen	1
but	1
sometimes	1
incidentally	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
sperm	1
fishermen	1
it	1
designates	1
the	1
dark	1
glutinous	1
substance	1
which	1
is	1
scraped	1
off	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1

much	1
of	1
which	1

who	1
hunt	1
that	1
ignoble	1
leviathan	1
	1
nippers	1
strictly	1
this	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
indigenous	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
vocabulary	1

as	1
applied	1
by	1
whalemen	1
it	1
becomes	1
so	1
a	1
whaleman	1

is	1
a	1
short	1
firm	1

of	1
tendinous	1

cut	1
from	1

averages	1
an	1
inch	1

for	1
the	1

is	1
about	1
the	1

the	1

were	1
strangely	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
capricious	1
emblazonings	1
of	1
the	1

on	1

the	1

the	1

dived	1
and	1
yet	1
steadfastly	1
shot	1
her	1
red	1
hell	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
scornfully	1
champed	1
the	1

in	1

burning	1
a	1

plunging	1
into	1
that	1
blackness	1

seemed	1
the	1
material	1
counterpart	1
of	1
her	1
monomaniac	1
commander	1

soul	1
	1
so	1
seemed	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
at	1
her	1
helm	1
and	1
for	1
long	1
hours	1
silently	1
guided	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
fire	1
ship	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
wrapped	1
for	1
that	1
interval	1
in	1
darkness	1
myself	1
i	1
but	1
the	1
better	1
saw	1
the	1
redness	1
the	1
madness	1
the	1
ghastliness	1
of	1
others	1
the	1
continual	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
shapes	1
before	1
me	1
capering	1
half	1
in	1
smoke	1
and	1
half	1
in	1
fire	1
these	1
at	1
last	1
begat	1
kindred	1
visions	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
that	1
unaccountable	1
drowsiness	1
which	1
ever	1
would	1
come	1
over	1
me	1
at	1
a	1
midnight	1
helm	1
	1
but	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
particular	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
ever	1
since	1
inexplicable	1
thing	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
starting	1
from	1
a	1
brief	1
standing	1
sleep	1
i	1
was	1
horribly	1
conscious	1
of	1
something	1
fatally	1
wrong	1
the	1
jaw	1
bone	1
tiller	1
smote	1
my	1
side	1
which	1
leaned	1
against	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
was	1
the	1
low	1
hum	1
of	1
sails	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
shake	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
i	1
thought	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
open	1
i	1
was	1
half	1
conscious	1
of	1
putting	1
my	1
fingers	1
to	1
the	1
lids	1
and	1
mechanically	1
stretching	1
them	1
still	1
further	1
apart	1
but	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
compass	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
steer	1
by	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
since	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
the	1
card	1
by	1
the	1
steady	1
binnacle	1
lamp	1
illuminating	1
it	1
nothing	1
seemed	1
before	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
jet	1
gloom	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
ghastly	1
by	1
flashes	1
of	1
redness	1
uppermost	1
was	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
whatever	1
swift	1
rushing	1
thing	1
i	1
stood	1
on	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
bound	1
to	1
any	1
haven	1
ahead	1
as	1
rushing	1
from	1
all	1
havens	1
astern	1
a	1
stark	1
bewildered	1
feeling	1
as	1
of	1
death	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
convulsively	1
my	1
hands	1
grasped	1
the	1
tiller	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
crazy	1
conceit	1
that	1
the	1
tiller	1
was	1
somehow	1
in	1
some	1
enchanted	1
way	1
inverted	1
my	1
god	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
thought	1
i	1
lo	1
in	1
my	1
brief	1
sleep	1
i	1
had	1
turned	1
myself	1
about	1
and	1
was	1
fronting	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
stern	1
with	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
prow	1
and	1
the	1
compass	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
i	1
faced	1
back	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
vessel	1
from	1
flying	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
very	1
probably	1
capsizing	1
her	1
how	1
glad	1
and	1
how	1
grateful	1
the	1
relief	1
from	1
this	1
unnatural	1
hallucination	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
fatal	1
contingency	1
of	1
being	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1

taking	1
regular	1
turns	1
at	1

in	1
the	1

narration	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
added	1
how	1
that	1
sometimes	1
in	1
these	1
walks	1
when	1
most	1
plunged	1
in	1
his	1
mood	1
he	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
pause	1
in	1
turn	1
at	1
each	1
spot	1
and	1
stand	1
there	1
strangely	1
eyeing	1
the	1
particular	1
object	1
before	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
halted	1
before	1
the	1
binnacle	1
with	1
his	1
glance	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
pointed	1
needle	1
in	1
the	1
compass	1
that	1
glance	1
shot	1
like	1
a	1
javelin	1
with	1
the	1
pointed	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
purpose	1
and	1
when	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk	1
he	1
again	1
paused	1
before	1
the	1
mainmast	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
riveted	1
glance	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
riveted	1
gold	1
coin	1
there	1
he	1
still	1
wore	1
the	1
same	1
aspect	1
of	1
nailed	1
firmness	1
only	1
dashed	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
wild	1
longing	1
if	1
not	1
hopefulness	1
	1
but	1
one	1
morning	1
turning	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
doubloon	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
newly	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
figures	1
and	1
inscriptions	1
stamped	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
beginning	1
to	1
interpret	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
monomaniac	1
way	1
whatever	1
significance	1
might	1
lurk	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
some	1
certain	1
significance	1
lurks	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
else	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
little	1
worth	1
and	1
the	1
round	1
world	1
itself	1
but	1
an	1
empty	1
cipher	1
except	1
to	1
sell	1
by	1
the	1
cartload	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
hills	1
about	1
boston	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
some	1
morass	1
in	1
the	1
milky	1
way	1
	1
now	1
this	1
doubloon	1
was	1
of	1
purest	1
virgin	1
gold	1
raked	1
somewhere	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
gorgeous	1
hills	1
whence	1
east	1
and	1
west	1
over	1
golden	1
sands	1
the	1
head	1
waters	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
pactolus	1
flows	1
and	1
though	1
now	1
nailed	1
amidst	1
all	1
the	1
rustiness	1
of	1
iron	1
bolts	1
and	1
the	1
verdigris	1
of	1
copper	1
spikes	1
yet	1
untouchable	1
and	1
immaculate	1
to	1
any	1
foulness	1
it	1
still	1
preserved	1
its	1
quito	1
glow	1
nor	1
though	1
placed	1
amongst	1
a	1
ruthless	1
crew	1
and	1
every	1
hour	1
passed	1
by	1
ruthless	1
hands	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
livelong	1
nights	1
shrouded	1
with	1
thick	1
darkness	1
which	1
might	1
cover	1
any	1
pilfering	1
approach	1
nevertheless	1
every	1
sunrise	1
found	1
the	1
doubloon	1
where	1
the	1
sunset	1
left	1
it	1
last	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
apart	1
and	1
sanctified	1
to	1
one	1
awe	1
striking	1
end	1
and	1
however	1
wanton	1
in	1
their	1
sailor	1
ways	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mariners	1
revered	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
talisman	1
sometimes	1
they	1
talked	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
weary	1
watch	1
by	1
night	1
wondering	1
whose	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
ever	1
live	1
to	1
spend	1
it	1
	1
now	1
those	1
noble	1
golden	1
coins	1
of	1
south	1

are	1
as	1
medals	1
of	1

ecliptics	1
horns	1
of	1
plenty	1
and	1
rich	1
banners	1
waving	1
are	1
in	1
luxuriant	1
profusion	1
stamped	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
precious	1
gold	1
seems	1
almost	1
to	1
derive	1
an	1
added	1
preciousness	1
and	1
enhancing	1
glories	1
by	1
passing	1
through	1
those	1
fancy	1
mints	1
so	1
spanishly	1
poetic	1
	1
it	1
so	1
chanced	1
that	1
the	1
doubloon	1
of	1
the	1

was	1
a	1
most	1
wealthy	1
example	1
of	1
these	1

on	1
its	1
round	1
border	1
it	1
bore	1
the	1
letters	1
republica	1
del	1

quito	1
so	1
this	1
bright	1
coin	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
country	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
beneath	1
the	1
great	1
equator	1

named	1
after	1

it	1
had	1
been	1
cast	1
midway	1
up	1
the	1

in	1
the	1
unwaning	1
clime	1
that	1
knows	1
no	1

zoned	1

	1
so	1
cried	1
ahab	1
once	1
more	1
hailing	1
a	1
ship	1
showing	1
english	1
colours	1
bearing	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
stern	1
trumpet	1
to	1
mouth	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
hoisted	1
quarter	1
boat	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
plainly	1
revealed	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
captain	1
who	1
was	1
carelessly	1
reclining	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
boat	1
s	1
bow	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
darkly	1
tanned	1
burly	1
good	1
natured	1
fine	1
looking	1
man	1
of	1
sixty	1
or	1
thereabouts	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
spacious	1
roundabout	1
that	1
hung	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
festoons	1
of	1
blue	1
pilot	1
cloth	1
and	1
one	1
empty	1
arm	1
of	1
this	1
jacket	1
streamed	1
behind	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
broidered	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
hussar	1
s	1
surcoat	1
	1
hast	1
seen	1
the	1
white	1

	1
see	1
you	1
this	1
and	1
withdrawing	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
folds	1
that	1
had	1
hidden	1
it	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
white	1
arm	1
of	1
sperm	1
whale	1
bone	1
terminating	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
mallet	1
	1
man	1
my	1
boat	1
cried	1
ahab	1
impetuously	1
and	1
tossing	1
about	1
the	1
oars	1
near	1
him	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
lower	1
	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
minute	1
without	1
quitting	1
his	1
little	1
craft	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
crew	1
were	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
were	1
soon	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
but	1
here	1
a	1
curious	1
difficulty	1
presented	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
ahab	1
had	1
forgotten	1
that	1
since	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
leg	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
once	1
stepped	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
any	1
vessel	1
at	1
sea	1
but	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
by	1
an	1
ingenious	1
and	1
very	1
handy	1
mechanical	1
contrivance	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
pequod	1
and	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
rigged	1
and	1
shipped	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
vessel	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
warning	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
easy	1
matter	1
for	1
anybody	1
except	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
almost	1
hourly	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
like	1
whalemen	1
to	1
clamber	1
up	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
from	1
a	1
boat	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
swells	1
now	1
lift	1
the	1
boat	1
high	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
and	1
then	1
instantaneously	1
drop	1
it	1
half	1
way	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
kelson	1
so	1
deprived	1
of	1
one	1
leg	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
ship	1
of	1
course	1
being	1
altogether	1
unsupplied	1
with	1
the	1
kindly	1
invention	1
ahab	1
now	1
found	1
himself	1
abjectly	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
clumsy	1
landsman	1
again	1
hopelessly	1
eyeing	1
the	1
uncertain	1
changeful	1
height	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
hope	1
to	1
attain	1
	1
it	1
has	1
before	1
been	1
hinted	1
perhaps	1
that	1
every	1
little	1
untoward	1
circumstance	1
that	1
befell	1
him	1
and	1
which	1
indirectly	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
luckless	1
mishap	1
almost	1
invariably	1
irritated	1
or	1
exasperated	1
ahab	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
ship	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
by	1
the	1
perpendicular	1
ladder	1
of	1
nailed	1
cleets	1
there	1
and	1
swinging	1
towards	1
him	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
tastefully	1
ornamented	1
man	1
ropes	1
for	1
at	1
first	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
bethink	1
them	1
that	1
a	1
one	1
legged	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
cripple	1
to	1
use	1
their	1
sea	1
bannisters	1
but	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
only	1
lasted	1
a	1
minute	1
because	1
the	1
strange	1
captain	1
observing	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
how	1
affairs	1
stood	1
cried	1
out	1
i	1
see	1
i	1
see	1
avast	1
heaving	1
there	1
jump	1
boys	1
and	1
swing	1
over	1
the	1
cutting	1
tackle	1
	1
as	1
good	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
whale	1
alongside	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
previous	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
tackles	1
were	1
still	1
aloft	1
and	1
the	1
massive	1
curved	1
blubber	1
hook	1
now	1
clean	1
and	1
dry	1
was	1
still	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
this	1
was	1
quickly	1
lowered	1
to	1
ahab	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
comprehending	1
it	1
all	1
slid	1
his	1
solitary	1
thigh	1
into	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
hook	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
fluke	1
of	1
an	1
anchor	1
or	1
the	1
crotch	1
of	1
an	1
apple	1
tree	1
and	1
then	1
giving	1
the	1
word	1
held	1
himself	1
fast	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
also	1
helped	1
to	1
hoist	1
his	1
own	1
weight	1
by	1
pulling	1
hand	1
over	1
hand	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
running	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
tackle	1
soon	1
he	1
was	1
carefully	1
swung	1
inside	1
the	1
high	1
bulwarks	1
and	1
gently	1
landed	1
upon	1
the	1
capstan	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
ivory	1
arm	1
frankly	1
thrust	1
forth	1
in	1
welcome	1
the	1
other	1
captain	1
advanced	1
and	1
ahab	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
ivory	1
arm	1
like	1
two	1
sword	1
fish	1
blades	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
walrus	1
way	1
aye	1
aye	1
hearty	1
let	1
us	1
shake	1
bones	1
together	1
an	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
leg	1
an	1
arm	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
shrink	1
d	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
a	1
leg	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
run	1
where	1
did	1
st	1
thou	1
see	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
how	1
long	1
ago	1
	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
pointing	1
his	1
ivory	1
arm	1
towards	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
rueful	1
sight	1
along	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
telescope	1
there	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
last	1
season	1
	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
that	1
arm	1
off	1
did	1
he	1
asked	1
ahab	1
now	1
sliding	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
capstan	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
englishman	1
s	1
shoulder	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
	1
aye	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
least	1
and	1
that	1
leg	1
too	1
	1
spin	1
me	1
the	1
yarn	1
said	1
ahab	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
cruised	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
began	1
the	1
englishman	1
i	1
was	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
well	1
one	1
day	1
we	1
lowered	1
for	1
a	1
pod	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
whales	1
and	1
my	1
boat	1
fastened	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
regular	1
circus	1
horse	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
that	1
went	1
milling	1
and	1
milling	1
round	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
could	1
only	1
trim	1
dish	1
by	1
sitting	1
all	1
their	1
sterns	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
gunwale	1
presently	1
up	1
breaches	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
a	1
bouncing	1
great	1
whale	1
with	1
a	1
milky	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
hump	1
all	1
crows	1
feet	1
and	1
wrinkles	1
	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
cried	1
ahab	1
suddenly	1
letting	1
out	1
his	1
suspended	1
breath	1
	1
and	1
harpoons	1
sticking	1
in	1
near	1
his	1
starboard	1
fin	1
	1
aye	1
aye	1
they	1
were	1
mine	1
my	1
irons	1
cried	1
ahab	1
exultingly	1
but	1
on	1
	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
chance	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
good	1
humoredly	1
well	1
this	1
old	1
great	1
grandfather	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
hump	1
runs	1
all	1
afoam	1
into	1
the	1
pod	1
and	1
goes	1
to	1
snapping	1
furiously	1
at	1
my	1
fast	1
line	1
	1
aye	1
i	1
see	1
wanted	1
to	1
part	1
it	1
free	1
the	1
fast	1
fish	1
an	1
old	1
trick	1
i	1
know	1
him	1
	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
continued	1
the	1
one	1
armed	1
commander	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
in	1
biting	1
the	1
line	1
it	1
got	1
foul	1
of	1
his	1
teeth	1
caught	1
there	1
somehow	1
but	1
we	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
then	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
afterwards	1
pulled	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
bounce	1
we	1
came	1
plump	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
hump	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
whale	1
s	1
that	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
windward	1
all	1
fluking	1
seeing	1
how	1
matters	1
stood	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
noble	1
great	1
whale	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
noblest	1
and	1
biggest	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
sir	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
capture	1
him	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
boiling	1
rage	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
and	1
thinking	1
the	1
hap	1
hazard	1
line	1
would	1
get	1
loose	1
or	1
the	1
tooth	1
it	1
was	1
tangled	1
to	1
might	1
draw	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
boat	1
s	1
crew	1
for	1
a	1
pull	1
on	1
a	1
whale	1
line	1
seeing	1
all	1
this	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
jumped	1
into	1
my	1
first	1
mate	1

the	1

as	1
i	1
was	1
saying	1
i	1
jumped	1
into	1

s	1
boat	1
which	1
d	1
ye	1
see	1
was	1
gunwale	1
and	1
gunwale	1
with	1
mine	1
then	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
first	1

let	1
this	1
old	1
great	1
grandfather	1
have	1
it	1
but	1
lord	1
look	1
you	1
sir	1
hearts	1
and	1
souls	1
alive	1
man	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
in	1
a	1
jiff	1
i	1
was	1
blind	1
as	1
a	1
bat	1
both	1
eyes	1
out	1
all	1
befogged	1
and	1
bedeadened	1
with	1
black	1
foam	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
tail	1
looming	1
straight	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
perpendicular	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
a	1
marble	1
steeple	1
no	1
use	1
sterning	1
all	1
then	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
groping	1
at	1
midday	1
with	1
a	1
blinding	1
sun	1
all	1
crown	1
jewels	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
groping	1
i	1
say	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
iron	1
to	1
toss	1
it	1
overboard	1
down	1
comes	1
the	1
tail	1
like	1
a	1
lima	1
tower	1
cutting	1
my	1
boat	1
in	1
two	1
leaving	1
each	1
half	1
in	1
splinters	1
and	1
flukes	1
first	1
the	1
white	1
hump	1
backed	1
through	1
the	1
wreck	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
chips	1
we	1
all	1
struck	1
out	1
to	1
escape	1
his	1
terrible	1
flailings	1
i	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
harpoon	1
pole	1
sticking	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
clung	1
to	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
sucking	1
fish	1
but	1
a	1
combing	1
sea	1
dashed	1
me	1
off	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
fish	1
taking	1
one	1
good	1
dart	1
forwards	1
went	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
flash	1
and	1
the	1
barb	1
of	1
that	1
cursed	1
second	1
iron	1
towing	1
along	1
near	1
me	1
caught	1
me	1
here	1
clapping	1
his	1
hand	1
just	1
below	1
his	1
shoulder	1
yes	1
caught	1
me	1
just	1
here	1
i	1
say	1
and	1
bore	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
s	1
flames	1
i	1
was	1
thinking	1
when	1
when	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
thank	1
the	1
good	1
god	1
the	1
barb	1
ript	1
its	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
flesh	1
clear	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
came	1
out	1
nigh	1
my	1
wrist	1
and	1
up	1
i	1
floated	1
and	1
that	1
gentleman	1
there	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1

rest	1
by	1

of	1
the	1
yarn	1
	1
the	1
professional	1
gentleman	1
thus	1
familiarly	1
pointed	1
out	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
standing	1
near	1
them	1
with	1
nothing	1
specific	1
visible	1
to	1
denote	1
his	1
gentlemanly	1
rank	1
on	1
board	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
round	1
but	1
sober	1
one	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
faded	1
blue	1
woollen	1
frock	1
or	1
shirt	1
and	1
patched	1
trowsers	1
and	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
dividing	1
his	1
attention	1
between	1
a	1
marlingspike	1

held	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
pill	1
box	1
held	1
in	1
the	1

occasionally	1
casting	1
a	1
critical	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
ivory	1
limbs	1
of	1
the	1

after	1

we	1

him	1
again	1
for	1
some	1

i	1
before	1

i	1
didn	1
t	1
then	1
know	1
what	1
whale	1

was	1
that	1

me	1
such	1
a	1
trick	1
till	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards	1
when	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
we	1
heard	1
about	1
moby	1
dick	1
as	1
some	1
call	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
	1
did	1
st	1
thou	1
cross	1
his	1

again	1
	1
twice	1
	1

what	1

without	1

doesn	1
t	1
bite	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
swallows	1
	1
well	1

interrupted	1

give	1
him	1
your	1
left	1
arm	1
for	1
bait	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
right	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
gentlemen	1
very	1
gravely	1
and	1
mathematically	1
bowing	1
to	1
each	1
captain	1
in	1
succession	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
gentlemen	1
that	1
the	1
digestive	1
organs	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
are	1
so	1
inscrutably	1
constructed	1
by	1
divine	1
providence	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
completely	1
digest	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
arm	1
and	1
he	1
knows	1
it	1
too	1
so	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
take	1
for	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
malice	1
is	1
only	1
his	1
awkwardness	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
means	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
single	1
limb	1
he	1
only	1
thinks	1
to	1
terrify	1
by	1
feints	1
but	1
sometimes	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
juggling	1
fellow	1
formerly	1
a	1
patient	1
of	1

there	1

for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1

more	1

i	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1

it	1
up	1
in	1
small	1
tacks	1
d	1
ye	1

no	1
possible	1
way	1
for	1

to	1
digest	1
that	1

and	1
fully	1
incorporate	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
general	1
bodily	1
system	1
yes	1
captain	1
boomer	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
quick	1
enough	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
pawn	1
one	1

for	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1

of	1
the	1

	1
the	1

named	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
fast	1
sailer	1
and	1
a	1
noble	1
craft	1
every	1
way	1
i	1
boarded	1
her	1
once	1
at	1
midnight	1
somewhere	1
off	1
the	1
patagonian	1
coast	1
and	1
drank	1
good	1
flip	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
gam	1
we	1
had	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
trumps	1
every	1
soul	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
short	1
life	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
jolly	1
death	1
and	1
that	1
fine	1
gam	1
i	1
had	1
long	1
very	1
long	1
after	1
old	1
ahab	1
touched	1
her	1
planks	1
with	1
his	1
ivory	1

it	1
minds	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
solid	1
saxon	1
hospitality	1
of	1
that	1
ship	1
and	1
may	1
my	1
parson	1
forget	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
remember	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
ever	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
flip	1
did	1
i	1
say	1
we	1
had	1
flip	1
yes	1
and	1
we	1
flipped	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
ten	1
gallons	1
the	1
hour	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
squall	1
came	1
for	1
it	1
s	1
squally	1
off	1
there	1
by	1
patagonia	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
visitors	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
called	1
to	1
reef	1
topsails	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
top	1
heavy	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
swing	1
each	1
other	1
aloft	1
in	1
bowlines	1
and	1
we	1
ignorantly	1
furled	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
our	1
jackets	1
into	1
the	1
sails	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
hung	1
there	1
reefed	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
howling	1
gale	1
a	1
warning	1
example	1
to	1
all	1
drunken	1
tars	1
however	1
the	1
masts	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
overboard	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
we	1
scrambled	1
down	1
so	1
sober	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
flip	1
again	1
though	1
the	1
savage	1
salt	1
spray	1
bursting	1
down	1
the	1
forecastle	1
scuttle	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
diluted	1
and	1
pickled	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
	1
the	1
beef	1
was	1
fine	1
tough	1
but	1
with	1
body	1
in	1
it	1
they	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
bull	1
beef	1
others	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
dromedary	1
beef	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
how	1
that	1
was	1
they	1
had	1
dumplings	1
too	1
small	1
but	1
substantial	1
symmetrically	1
globular	1
and	1
indestructible	1
dumplings	1
i	1
fancied	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
feel	1
them	1
and	1
roll	1
them	1
about	1
in	1
you	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
swallowed	1
if	1
you	1
stooped	1
over	1
too	1
far	1
forward	1
you	1
risked	1
their	1
pitching	1
out	1
of	1
you	1
like	1
billiard	1
balls	1
the	1
bread	1
but	1
that	1
couldn	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
besides	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
anti	1
scorbutic	1
in	1
short	1
the	1
bread	1
contained	1
the	1
only	1
fresh	1
fare	1
they	1
had	1
but	1
the	1
forecastle	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
light	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
step	1
over	1
into	1
a	1
dark	1
corner	1
when	1
you	1
ate	1
it	1
but	1
all	1
in	1
all	1
taking	1
her	1
from	1
truck	1
to	1
helm	1
considering	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
cook	1
s	1
boilers	1
including	1
his	1
own	1
live	1
parchment	1
boilers	1
fore	1
and	1
aft	1
i	1
say	1
the	1
samuel	1
enderby	1
was	1
a	1
jolly	1
ship	1
of	1
good	1
fare	1
and	1
plenty	1
fine	1
flip	1
and	1
strong	1
crack	1
fellows	1
all	1
and	1
capital	1
from	1
boot	1
heels	1
to	1
hat	1
band	1
	1
but	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
samuel	1
enderby	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
english	1
whalers	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
not	1
all	1
though	1
were	1
such	1
famous	1
hospitable	1
ships	1
that	1
passed	1
round	1
the	1
beef	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
the	1
can	1
and	1
the	1
joke	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
soon	1
weary	1
of	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
and	1
laughing	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
abounding	1
good	1
cheer	1
of	1
these	1
english	1
whalers	1
is	1
matter	1
for	1
historical	1
research	1
nor	1
have	1
i	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
sparing	1
of	1
historical	1
whale	1
research	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
seemed	1
needed	1
	1
the	1
english	1
were	1
preceded	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
fishery	1
by	1
the	1
hollanders	1
zealanders	1
and	1
danes	1
from	1
whom	1
they	1
derived	1
many	1
terms	1
still	1
extant	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
yet	1
more	1
their	1
fat	1
old	1
fashions	1
touching	1
plenty	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
for	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
thing	1
the	1
english	1
merchant	1
ship	1
scrimps	1
her	1
crew	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
the	1
english	1
whaler	1
hence	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
whaling	1
good	1
cheer	1
is	1
not	1
normal	1
and	1
natural	1
but	1
incidental	1
and	1
particular	1
and	1
therefore	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
special	1
origin	1
which	1
is	1
here	1
pointed	1
out	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
further	1
elucidated	1
	1
during	1
my	1
researches	1
in	1
the	1
leviathanic	1
histories	1
i	1
stumbled	1
upon	1
an	1
ancient	1
dutch	1
volume	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
musty	1
whaling	1
smell	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
knew	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
whalers	1
the	1
title	1
was	1
dan	1
coopman	1
wherefore	1
i	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
invaluable	1
memoirs	1
of	1
some	1
amsterdam	1
cooper	1
in	1
the	1
fishery	1
as	1
every	1
whale	1
ship	1
must	1
carry	1
its	1
cooper	1
i	1
was	1
reinforced	1
in	1
this	1
opinion	1
by	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
one	1
fitz	1
swackhammer	1
but	1
my	1
friend	1
dr	1
snodhead	1
a	1
very	1
learned	1
man	1
professor	1
of	1
low	1
dutch	1
and	1
high	1
german	1
in	1
the	1
college	1
of	1
santa	1
claus	1
and	1
st	1
pott	1
s	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
handed	1
the	1
work	1
for	1
translation	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
sperm	1
candles	1
for	1
his	1
trouble	1
this	1
same	1
dr	1
snodhead	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
spied	1
the	1
book	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
dan	1
coopman	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
the	1
cooper	1
but	1
the	1
merchant	1
in	1
short	1
this	1
ancient	1
and	1
learned	1
low	1
dutch	1
book	1
treated	1
of	1
the	1
commerce	1
of	1
holland	1
and	1
among	1
other	1
subjects	1
contained	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
whale	1
fishery	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
chapter	1
it	1
was	1
headed	1
smeer	1
or	1
fat	1
that	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
long	1
detailed	1
list	1
of	1
the	1

for	1
the	1
larders	1
and	1
cellars	1
of	1
180	1

of	1
dutch	1
whalemen	1
from	1
which	1
list	1
as	1
translated	1
by	1

transcribe	1
the	1

parchingly	1

in	1
the	1

not	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
however	1
where	1
the	1
reader	1
is	1
flooded	1
with	1
whole	1
pipes	1
barrels	1
quarts	1
and	1
gills	1
of	1
good	1
gin	1
and	1
good	1
cheer	1
	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
devoted	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
the	1
studious	1
digesting	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
beer	1
beef	1
and	1
bread	1
during	1
which	1
many	1
profound	1
thoughts	1
were	1
incidentally	1
suggested	1
to	1
me	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
transcendental	1
and	1
platonic	1
application	1
and	1
furthermore	1
i	1
compiled	1
supplementary	1
tables	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
touching	1
the	1
probable	1
quantity	1
of	1
stock	1
fish	1
etc	1
consumed	1
by	1
every	1
low	1
dutch	1
harpooneer	1
in	1
that	1
ancient	1
greenland	1
and	1
spitzbergen	1
whale	1
fishery	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
butter	1
and	1
texel	1
and	1
leyden	1
cheese	1
consumed	1
seems	1
amazing	1
i	1
impute	1
it	1
though	1
to	1
their	1
naturally	1
unctuous	1
natures	1
being	1
rendered	1
still	1
more	1
unctuous	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
vocation	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
their	1
pursuing	1
their	1
game	1
in	1
those	1
frigid	1
polar	1
seas	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
coasts	1
of	1
that	1
esquimaux	1
country	1
where	1
the	1
convivial	1
natives	1
pledge	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
bumpers	1
of	1
train	1
oil	1
	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
beer	1
too	1
is	1
very	1
large	1
10	1
800	1
barrels	1
now	1
as	1
those	1
polar	1
fisheries	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
prosecuted	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
summer	1
of	1
that	1
climate	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
cruise	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
dutch	1
whalemen	1
including	1
the	1
short	1
voyage	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
spitzbergen	1
sea	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
exceed	1
three	1
months	1
say	1
and	1
reckoning	1
30	1
men	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
their	1
fleet	1
of	1
180	1
sail	1
we	1
have	1
5	1
400	1
low	1
dutch	1
seamen	1
in	1
all	1
therefore	1
i	1
say	1
we	1
have	1
precisely	1
two	1
barrels	1
of	1
beer	1
per	1
man	1
for	1
a	1
twelve	1
weeks	1
allowance	1
exclusive	1
of	1
his	1
fair	1
proportion	1
of	1
that	1
550	1
ankers	1
of	1
gin	1
now	1
whether	1
these	1
gin	1
and	1
beer	1
harpooneers	1
so	1
fuddled	1
as	1
one	1
might	1
fancy	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
were	1
the	1
right	1
sort	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
take	1
good	1
aim	1
at	1
flying	1
whales	1
this	1
would	1
seem	1
somewhat	1
improbable	1
yet	1
they	1
did	1
aim	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
hit	1
them	1
too	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
north	1
be	1
it	1
remembered	1
where	1
beer	1
agrees	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
constitution	1
upon	1
the	1
equator	1
in	1
our	1
southern	1
fishery	1
beer	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
harpooneer	1
sleepy	1
at	1
the	1
mast	1
head	1
and	1
boozy	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
and	1
grievous	1
loss	1
might	1
ensue	1
to	1
nantucket	1
and	1
new	1
bedford	1
	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
enough	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
dutch	1
whalers	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
centuries	1
ago	1
were	1
high	1
livers	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
english	1
whalers	1
have	1
not	1
neglected	1
so	1
excellent	1
an	1
example	1
for	1
say	1
they	1
when	1
cruising	1
in	1
an	1
empty	1
ship	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
nothing	1
better	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
dinner	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
least	1

	1
	1
hitherto	1
in	1
descriptively	1
treating	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
i	1
have	1
chiefly	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
marvels	1
of	1
his	1
outer	1
aspect	1
or	1
separately	1
and	1
in	1
detail	1
upon	1
some	1
few	1
interior	1
structural	1
features	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
thorough	1
sweeping	1
comprehension	1
of	1
him	1
it	1
behooves	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
unbutton	1
him	1
still	1
further	1
and	1
untagging	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
hose	1
unbuckling	1
his	1
garters	1
and	1
casting	1
loose	1
the	1
hooks	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
innermost	1
bones	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
ultimatum	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
unconditional	1
skeleton	1
	1
but	1
how	1
now	1
ishmael	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
a	1
mere	1
oarsman	1
in	1
the	1

the	1

more	1
i	1
marvelled	1
that	1
the	1

should	1
swear	1
that	1
smoky	1
jet	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
genuine	1
to	1

i	1
paced	1

through	1

with	1
a	1

twine	1
wandered	1
eddied	1
long	1
amid	1
its	1
many	1
winding	1

but	1
soon	1
my	1

was	1
out	1

following	1
it	1
back	1
i	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1

i	1
entered	1
i	1
saw	1
no	1

naught	1
was	1
there	1
but	1
bones	1
	1
cutting	1
me	1
a	1

i	1
once	1
more	1
dived	1
within	1
the	1
skeleton	1
from	1
their	1
arrow	1
slit	1
in	1
the	1
skull	1
the	1
priests	1
perceived	1
me	1
taking	1
the	1
altitude	1
of	1
the	1
final	1

how	1
now	1
they	1
shouted	1

for	1

well	1
how	1

ye	1
make	1

then	1
but	1
hereupon	1
a	1
fierce	1
contest	1
rose	1
among	1
them	1
concerning	1
feet	1

inches	1
they	1
cracked	1
each	1

of	1
sixty	1
feet	1
in	1

according	1
to	1
my	1

say	1
a	1
sperm	1

of	1
the	1
largest	1
magnitude	1
between	1
eighty	1
five	1

ninety	1
feet	1

something	1
less	1
than	1
forty	1

in	1
its	1

such	1
a	1

will	1
weigh	1
at	1

ninety	1

out	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
interesting	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
bulk	1
of	1
his	1
unobstructed	1
bones	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
colossal	1

embraces	1
so	1
very	1
large	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
skeleton	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
complicated	1
part	1
and	1
as	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
repeated	1
concerning	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
chapter	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
or	1
under	1
your	1
arm	1
as	1
we	1
proceed	1
otherwise	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
gain	1
a	1
complete	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
structure	1
we	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
view	1
	1
in	1
length	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
s	1
skeleton	1
at	1
tranque	1
measured	1
seventy	1
two	1
feet	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
fully	1
invested	1
and	1
extended	1
in	1
life	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
ninety	1
feet	1
long	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
whale	1
the	1
skeleton	1
loses	1
about	1
one	1
fifth	1
in	1

compared	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
seventy	1
two	1
feet	1
his	1
skull	1
and	1
jaw	1
comprised	1
some	1
twenty	1
feet	1
leaving	1
some	1
fifty	1
feet	1
of	1
plain	1
back	1
bone	1
attached	1
to	1
this	1
back	1
bone	1
for	1
something	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
its	1
length	1
was	1
the	1
mighty	1
circular	1
basket	1
of	1
ribs	1
which	1
once	1
enclosed	1
his	1
vitals	1
	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
vast	1
ivory	1
ribbed	1
chest	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
unrelieved	1
spine	1
extending	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
resembled	1
the	1
hull	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
ship	1
new	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
stocks	1
when	1
only	1
some	1
twenty	1
of	1
her	1
naked	1
bow	1
ribs	1
are	1
inserted	1
and	1
the	1
keel	1
is	1
otherwise	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
a	1
long	1
disconnected	1
timber	1
	1
the	1
ribs	1
were	1
ten	1
on	1
a	1
side	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
begin	1
from	1
the	1
neck	1
was	1
nearly	1
six	1
feet	1
long	1
the	1
second	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
were	1
each	1
successively	1
longer	1
till	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
the	1
fifth	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
ribs	1
which	1
measured	1
eight	1
feet	1
and	1
some	1
inches	1
from	1
that	1
part	1
the	1
remaining	1
ribs	1
diminished	1
till	1
the	1
tenth	1
and	1
last	1
only	1
spanned	1
five	1
feet	1
and	1
some	1
inches	1
in	1
general	1
thickness	1
they	1
all	1
bore	1
a	1
seemly	1
correspondence	1
to	1
their	1
length	1
the	1
middle	1
ribs	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
arched	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
arsacides	1
they	1
are	1
used	1
for	1
beams	1
whereon	1
to	1
lay	1
footpath	1
bridges	1
over	1
small	1
streams	1
	1
in	1
considering	1
these	1
ribs	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
struck	1
anew	1
with	1
the	1
circumstance	1
so	1
variously	1
repeated	1
in	1
this	1
book	1
that	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
mould	1
of	1
his	1
invested	1
form	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
the	1
tranque	1
ribs	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
ones	1
occupied	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
greatest	1
in	1
depth	1
now	1
the	1
greatest	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
invested	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
whale	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
least	1
sixteen	1
feet	1
whereas	1
the	1
corresponding	1
rib	1
measured	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
eight	1
feet	1
so	1
that	1
this	1
rib	1
only	1
conveyed	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
magnitude	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
besides	1
for	1
some	1
way	1
where	1
i	1
now	1
saw	1
but	1
a	1
naked	1
spine	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
once	1
wrapped	1
round	1
with	1
tons	1
of	1
added	1
bulk	1
in	1
flesh	1
muscle	1
blood	1
and	1
bowels	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
ample	1
fins	1
i	1
here	1
saw	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
disordered	1
joints	1
and	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
weighty	1
and	1
majestic	1
but	1
boneless	1
flukes	1
an	1
utter	1
blank	1
	1
how	1
vain	1
and	1
foolish	1
then	1
thought	1
i	1
for	1
timid	1
untravelled	1
man	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
comprehend	1
aright	1
this	1
wondrous	1
whale	1
by	1
merely	1
poring	1
over	1
his	1
dead	1
attenuated	1
skeleton	1
stretched	1
in	1
this	1
peaceful	1
wood	1
no	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
quickest	1
perils	1
only	1
when	1
within	1
the	1
eddyings	1
of	1
his	1
angry	1
flukes	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
profound	1
unbounded	1
sea	1
can	1
the	1
fully	1
invested	1
whale	1
be	1
truly	1
and	1
livingly	1
found	1
out	1
	1
but	1
the	1
spine	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
we	1
can	1
consider	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
a	1
crane	1
to	1
pile	1
its	1
bones	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
end	1
no	1
speedy	1
enterprise	1
but	1
now	1
it	1

done	1
it	1
looks	1
much	1

	1
there	1
are	1
forty	1
and	1
odd	1
vertebrae	1
in	1
all	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton	1
are	1
not	1
locked	1
together	1
they	1
mostly	1
lie	1
like	1
the	1
great	1
knobbed	1
blocks	1
on	1
a	1
gothic	1
spire	1
forming	1
solid	1
courses	1
of	1

where	1
the	1

away	1
into	1

a	1

that	1
there	1
were	1

	1
from	1

a	1

theme	1

to	1
enlarge	1

omnisciently	1

in	1
the	1
enterprise	1
not	1
overlooking	1
the	1
minutest	1

of	1

and	1
spinning	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1

already	1

of	1

it	1
now	1
remains	1
to	1
magnify	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
archaeological	1
fossiliferous	1

antediluvian	1
point	1
of	1

applied	1

us	1
from	1
the	1

it	1
may	1
be	1
fitly	1
inquired	1
whether	1
in	1

of	1

he	1

not	1
degenerated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
bulk	1
of	1
his	1
sires	1
	1
but	1
upon	1
investigation	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
are	1
the	1
whales	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
superior	1
in	1
magnitude	1
to	1
those	1
whose	1

in	1
the	1

of	1

whales	1
found	1
in	1
that	1
tertiary	1

those	1
belonging	1
to	1
its	1
latter	1

exceed	1
in	1
size	1
those	1
of	1
its	1
earlier	1
ones	1
	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pre	1
adamite	1
whales	1
yet	1
exhumed	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
largest	1
is	1
the	1
alabama	1
one	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chapter	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
seventy	1
feet	1
in	1
length	1
in	1
the	1
skeleton	1
whereas	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
tape	1
measure	1
gives	1
seventy	1
two	1
feet	1
for	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
sized	1
modern	1
whale	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
on	1
whalemen	1
s	1
authority	1
that	1
sperm	1
whales	1
have	1
been	1
captured	1
near	1
a	1
hundred	1
feet	1
long	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
capture	1
	1
but	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
whales	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
hour	1
are	1
an	1
advance	1
in	1
magnitude	1
upon	1
those	1
of	1
all	1
previous	1

periods	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
since	1
adam	1
s	1
time	1
they	1
have	1
degenerated	1
	1
assuredly	1
we	1
must	1
conclude	1
so	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
such	1
gentlemen	1
as	1

will	1
any	1

believe	1

no	1
the	1

is	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
his	1

if	1
ever	1
i	1
go	1
where	1
pliny	1
is	1
i	1
a	1
whaleman	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
will	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
so	1
because	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
egyptian	1
mummies	1
that	1
were	1
buried	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
before	1
even	1
pliny	1
was	1
born	1
do	1
not	1
measure	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
their	1
coffins	1
as	1
a	1
modern	1
kentuckian	1
in	1
his	1
socks	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
other	1
animals	1
sculptured	1
on	1
the	1
oldest	1
egyptian	1

by	1
the	1
relative	1
proportions	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
drawn	1
just	1

prove	1
that	1
the	1

fed	1
prize	1

of	1

not	1
only	1
equal	1

the	1

of	1
pharaoh	1
s	1
fat	1
kine	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
all	1
this	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
animals	1
the	1
whale	1
alone	1
should	1
have	1
degenerated	1
	1
but	1
still	1
another	1
inquiry	1
remains	1
one	1
often	1
agitated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
recondite	1
nantucketers	1
whether	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
omniscient	1
look	1
outs	1
at	1
the	1
mast	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
whaleships	1
now	1
penetrating	1
even	1
through	1
behring	1
s	1
straits	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
remotest	1
secret	1
drawers	1
and	1
lockers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances	1
darted	1
along	1
all	1
continental	1
coasts	1
the	1
moot	1
point	1
is	1
whether	1
leviathan	1
can	1
long	1
endure	1
so	1
wide	1
a	1
chase	1
and	1
so	1
remorseless	1
a	1
havoc	1
whether	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
at	1
last	1
be	1
exterminated	1
from	1
the	1
waters	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
whale	1
like	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
smoke	1
his	1
last	1
pipe	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
evaporate	1
in	1
the	1
final	1
puff	1
	1
comparing	1
the	1
humped	1
herds	1
of	1
whales	1
with	1
the	1
humped	1
herds	1
of	1
buffalo	1
which	1
not	1
forty	1
years	1
ago	1
overspread	1
by	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
the	1
prairies	1
of	1
illinois	1
and	1
missouri	1
and	1
shook	1
their	1
iron	1
manes	1
and	1
scowled	1
with	1
their	1
thunder	1
clotted	1
brows	1
upon	1
the	1
sites	1
of	1
populous	1
river	1
capitals	1
where	1
now	1
the	1
polite	1
broker	1
sells	1
you	1
land	1
at	1
a	1
dollar	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
comparison	1
an	1
irresistible	1
argument	1
would	1
seem	1
furnished	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
hunted	1
whale	1
cannot	1
now	1
escape	1
speedy	1
extinction	1
	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
matter	1
in	1
every	1
light	1
though	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
period	1
ago	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
lifetime	1
the	1
census	1
of	1
the	1
buffalo	1
in	1
illinois	1
exceeded	1
the	1
census	1
of	1
men	1
now	1
in	1
london	1
and	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
not	1
one	1
horn	1
or	1
hoof	1
of	1
them	1
remains	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
region	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
wondrous	1
extermination	1
was	1
the	1
spear	1
of	1
man	1
yet	1
the	1
far	1
different	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
hunt	1
peremptorily	1
forbids	1
so	1
inglorious	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
leviathan	1

any	1
argument	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
gradual	1
extinction	1
of	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
for	1
example	1
that	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century	1
say	1
these	1
leviathans	1
in	1
small	1
pods	1
were	1
encountered	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
at	1
present	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
the	1
voyages	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
prolonged	1
and	1
were	1
also	1
much	1
more	1
remunerative	1
because	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1

those	1

by	1
some	1
views	1

safety	1

degree	1
the	1
scattered	1
solitaries	1

are	1
now	1
aggregated	1
into	1
vast	1

widely	1
separated	1
unfrequent	1
armies	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
and	1
equally	1
fallacious	1
seems	1
the	1
conceit	1
that	1
because	1
the	1
so	1
called	1
whale	1
bone	1
whales	1
no	1
longer	1
haunt	1
many	1
grounds	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
abounding	1
with	1
them	1
hence	1
that	1
species	1
also	1
is	1
declining	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
being	1
driven	1
from	1
promontory	1
to	1
cape	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
coast	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
enlivened	1
with	1
their	1
jets	1
then	1
be	1
sure	1
some	1
other	1
and	1
remoter	1
strand	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
recently	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
spectacle	1
	1
furthermore	1
concerning	1
these	1
last	1
mentioned	1
leviathans	1
they	1
have	1
two	1
firm	1
fortresses	1
which	1
in	1
all	1
human	1
probability	1
will	1
for	1
ever	1
remain	1
impregnable	1
and	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
invasion	1
of	1
their	1

the	1
frosty	1

have	1
retreated	1
to	1
their	1

from	1
the	1

and	1
glades	1
of	1
the	1

the	1

at	1

resort	1
to	1
their	1

to	1

harpooned	1
for	1
one	1

some	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1

have	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
positive	1
havoc	1
has	1
already	1
very	1
seriously	1
diminished	1
their	1
battalions	1
but	1
though	1
for	1
some	1

past	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
whales	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
13	1
000	1
have	1
been	1
annually	1
slain	1
on	1
the	1
nor	1
west	1
coast	1
by	1
the	1
americans	1
alone	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
considerations	1
which	1
render	1
even	1
this	1
circumstance	1
of	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
account	1
as	1
an	1
opposing	1
argument	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
	1
natural	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
incredulous	1
concerning	1
the	1
populousness	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
enormous	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
yet	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
harto	1
the	1
historian	1
of	1
goa	1
when	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
at	1
one	1
hunting	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
siam	1
took	1
4	1
000	1
elephants	1
that	1
in	1
those	1
regions	1
elephants	1
are	1
numerous	1
as	1
droves	1
of	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
temperate	1
climes	1
and	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
elephants	1
which	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
hunted	1
for	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
by	1
semiramis	1
by	1
porus	1
by	1
hannibal	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
successive	1
monarchs	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
if	1
they	1
still	1
survive	1
there	1
in	1
great	1
numbers	1
much	1
more	1
may	1
the	1
great	1
whale	1
outlast	1
all	1
hunting	1
since	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
pasture	1
to	1
expatiate	1
in	1
which	1
is	1
precisely	1
twice	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
all	1
asia	1
both	1
americas	1

and	1
all	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

combined	1
	1
moreover	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
presumed	1
great	1
longevity	1
of	1
whales	1
their	1
probably	1
attaining	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
a	1
century	1

more	1
therefore	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
period	1
of	1
time	1
several	1
distinct	1

generations	1
must	1
be	1
contemporary	1
and	1
what	1
that	1
is	1
we	1
may	1
soon	1
gain	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
by	1
imagining	1
all	1
the	1

up	1

to	1

the	1

	1
	1
the	1
precipitating	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
captain	1
ahab	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
samuel	1
enderby	1
of	1
london	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
unattended	1
with	1
some	1
small	1
violence	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
person	1
he	1
had	1
lighted	1
with	1
such	1
energy	1
upon	1
a	1
thwart	1
of	1
his	1
boat	1
that	1
his	1
ivory	1
leg	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
half	1
splintering	1
shock	1
and	1
when	1
after	1
gaining	1
his	1
own	1
deck	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
pivot	1
hole	1
there	1
he	1
so	1
vehemently	1
wheeled	1
round	1
with	1
an	1
urgent	1
command	1
to	1
the	1
steersman	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
ever	1
something	1
about	1
his	1
not	1
steering	1
inflexibly	1
enough	1
then	1
the	1
already	1
shaken	1
ivory	1
received	1
such	1
an	1
additional	1
twist	1
and	1
wrench	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
still	1
remained	1
entire	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearances	1
lusty	1
yet	1
ahab	1
did	1
not	1
deem	1
it	1
entirely	1
trustworthy	1
	1
and	1
indeed	1
it	1
seemed	1
small	1
matter	1
for	1
wonder	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
pervading	1
mad	1
recklessness	1
ahab	1
did	1
at	1
times	1
give	1
careful	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
that	1
dead	1
bone	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
partly	1
stood	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
long	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
pequod	1
s	1
sailing	1
from	1
nantucket	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
one	1
night	1
lying	1
prone	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
insensible	1
by	1
some	1
unknown	1
and	1
seemingly	1
inexplicable	1
unimaginable	1
casualty	1
his	1
ivory	1
limb	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
violently	1
displaced	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
stake	1
wise	1
smitten	1
and	1
all	1
but	1
pierced	1
his	1
groin	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
without	1
extreme	1
difficulty	1
that	1
the	1
agonizing	1
wound	1
was	1
entirely	1
cured	1
	1
nor	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
it	1
failed	1
to	1
enter	1
his	1
monomaniac	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
that	1
then	1
present	1
suffering	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
direct	1
issue	1
of	1
a	1
former	1
woe	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
plainly	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
poisonous	1
reptile	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
perpetuates	1
his	1
kind	1
as	1
inevitably	1
as	1
the	1
sweetest	1
songster	1
of	1
the	1
grove	1

both	1
the	1
ancestry	1
and	1

of	1
grief	1
go	1
further	1
than	1
the	1
ancestry	1
and	1
posterity	1
of	1
joy	1
for	1
not	1
to	1
hint	1
of	1
this	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
inference	1
from	1
certain	1
canonic	1
teachings	1
that	1
while	1
some	1
natural	1
enjoyments	1
here	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
world	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
shall	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
joy	1
childlessness	1
of	1
all	1
hell	1
s	1
despair	1
whereas	1
some	1
guilty	1
mortal	1
miseries	1
shall	1
still	1
fertilely	1
beget	1
to	1
themselves	1
an	1
eternally	1
progressive	1
progeny	1
of	1
griefs	1
beyond	1
the	1

not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1

of	1
this	1
there	1
still	1
seems	1
an	1
inequality	1
in	1
the	1
deeper	1
analysis	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
thought	1
ahab	1
while	1
even	1
the	1
highest	1
earthly	1
felicities	1
ever	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
unsignifying	1
pettiness	1
lurking	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
at	1
bottom	1
all	1
heartwoes	1
a	1
mystic	1
significance	1

in	1
some	1

an	1
archangelic	1

the	1

of	1
sorrow	1
in	1
the	1

	1
unwittingly	1
here	1
a	1
secret	1
has	1
been	1
divulged	1
which	1
perhaps	1
might	1
more	1
properly	1
in	1
set	1
way	1
have	1
been	1
disclosed	1
before	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
particulars	1
concerning	1
ahab	1
always	1
had	1
it	1
remained	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
some	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
period	1
both	1
before	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
sailing	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
he	1
had	1
hidden	1
himself	1
away	1
with	1
such	1
grand	1
lama	1
like	1
exclusiveness	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
interval	1
sought	1
speechless	1
refuge	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
marble	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
captain	1
peleg	1

bruited	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
appeared	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
adequate	1
though	1
indeed	1
as	1
touching	1
all	1
ahab	1
s	1
deeper	1
part	1
every	1
revelation	1
partook	1
more	1
of	1
significant	1
darkness	1
than	1
of	1
explanatory	1
light	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
out	1
this	1
one	1
matter	1
did	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
direful	1
mishap	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
temporary	1
recluseness	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
ever	1
contracting	1
dropping	1
circle	1
ashore	1
who	1
for	1
any	1
reason	1
possessed	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
a	1
less	1
banned	1
approach	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
that	1
timid	1
circle	1
the	1
above	1
hinted	1
casualty	1
remaining	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
moodily	1
unaccounted	1
for	1
by	1
ahab	1
invested	1
itself	1
with	1
terrors	1
not	1
entirely	1
underived	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
of	1
wails	1
so	1
that	1
through	1
their	1
zeal	1
for	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
conspired	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
in	1
them	1
lay	1
to	1
muffle	1
up	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
from	1
others	1
and	1
hence	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
not	1
till	1
a	1
considerable	1
interval	1
had	1
elapsed	1
did	1
it	1
transpire	1
upon	1
the	1

with	1
earthly	1
ahab	1
yet	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
matter	1
of	1
his	1
leg	1
he	1
took	1
plain	1
practical	1
procedures	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
carpenter	1
	1
and	1
when	1
that	1
functionary	1
appeared	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
bade	1
him	1
without	1
delay	1
set	1
about	1
making	1
a	1
new	1
leg	1

directed	1
the	1
mates	1
to	1

supplied	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
studs	1
and	1
joists	1
of	1
jaw	1
ivory	1

which	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
been	1
accumulated	1
on	1
the	1
voyage	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
a	1
careful	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
stoutest	1
clearest	1
grained	1
stuff	1
might	1
be	1
secured	1
this	1
done	1
the	1
carpenter	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
leg	1
completed	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
to	1
provide	1
all	1
the	1
fittings	1
for	1
it	1
independent	1
of	1

to	1
the	1
distrusted	1

the	1

for	1
the	1

with	1
such	1
liveliness	1
of	1
expertness	1
in	1

too	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
argue	1
some	1
uncommon	1
vivacity	1
of	1
intelligence	1
but	1
not	1
precisely	1
so	1
for	1
nothing	1
was	1
this	1
man	1
more	1
remarkable	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
impersonal	1
stolidity	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
impersonal	1
i	1
say	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
shaded	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
surrounding	1
infinite	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
stolidity	1
discernible	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
visible	1
world	1
which	1
while	1
pauselessly	1
active	1
in	1
uncounted	1
modes	1
still	1
eternally	1
holds	1
its	1
peace	1
and	1
ignores	1
you	1
though	1
you	1
dig	1
foundations	1
for	1
cathedrals	1
yet	1
was	1
this	1
half	1
horrible	1
stolidity	1
in	1
him	1
involving	1
too	1
as	1
it	1
appeared	1
an	1
all	1
ramifying	1
heartlessness	1
yet	1
was	1
it	1
oddly	1
dashed	1
at	1
times	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
crutch	1
like	1
antediluvian	1
wheezing	1
humorousness	1
not	1
unstreaked	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
grizzled	1
wittiness	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1

during	1
the	1
midnight	1
watch	1
on	1
the	1
bearded	1
forecastle	1
of	1
noah	1

it	1
that	1
this	1

a	1

long	1
wanderer	1
whose	1
much	1
rolling	1
to	1

fro	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
gathered	1
no	1
moss	1

what	1
is	1
more	1
had	1
rubbed	1
off	1
whatever	1
small	1
outward	1
clingings	1
might	1
have	1
originally	1
pertained	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stript	1
abstract	1
an	1
unfractioned	1
integral	1
uncompromised	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
born	1
babe	1
living	1
without	1
premeditated	1
reference	1
to	1
this	1
world	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
you	1
might	1
almost	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
strange	1
uncompromisedness	1
in	1
him	1
involved	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
unintelligence	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
numerous	1
trades	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
work	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
reason	1
or	1
by	1
instinct	1
or	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
tutored	1
to	1
it	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
intermixture	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
even	1
or	1
uneven	1
but	1
merely	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
deaf	1
and	1
dumb	1
spontaneous	1
literal	1
process	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
pure	1
manipulator	1
his	1
brain	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
early	1
oozed	1
along	1
into	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
he	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unreasoning	1

still	1
highly	1

to	1
use	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
a	1
screw	1
driver	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
open	1
that	1

of	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
screw	1
was	1
fast	1

if	1
for	1

take	1
him	1
up	1
by	1

after	1

if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
soul	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
subtle	1
something	1
that	1
somehow	1
anomalously	1
did	1
its	1
duty	1
what	1
that	1
was	1

for	1

some	1
sixty	1

was	1
this	1

unaccountable	1

this	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
soliloquizing	1
but	1
only	1
like	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
wheel	1
which	1
also	1
hummingly	1
soliloquizes	1
or	1
rather	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
a	1

this	1
soliloquizer	1
on	1

sir	1
how	1
that	1
a	1

how	1

thou	1
know	1
that	1
some	1

not	1
be	1
invisibly	1

thou	1

standing	1
there	1
in	1
thy	1

in	1
thy	1

further	1
into	1
the	1

with	1
a	1
daring	1
so	1
strangely	1
respectful	1
and	1
cautious	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
seemed	1
not	1
only	1
every	1
way	1
seeking	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
slightest	1
outward	1
manifestation	1
of	1
itself	1

seemed	1

for	1

in	1
the	1

eyes	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
his	1
fiery	1
cheeks	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
received	1
the	1
blaze	1
of	1
the	1
levelled	1
tube	1
but	1
mastering	1
his	1
emotion	1
he	1
half	1
calmly	1
rose	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
cabin	1
paused	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
said	1
thou	1
hast	1
outraged	1

for	1
that	1
i	1
ask	1
thee	1

then	1
unconsciously	1
using	1
the	1
musket	1
for	1
a	1
staff	1
with	1
an	1
iron	1

he	1
paced	1
to	1
and	1

in	1
the	1
little	1
cabin	1
but	1
presently	1
the	1
thick	1
plaits	1
of	1
his	1

relaxed	1

returning	1
the	1

have	1
been	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
honesty	1
in	1
him	1

mere	1
prudential	1
policy	1
which	1
under	1

imperiously	1
forbade	1

found	1
that	1
the	1

struck	1
into	1
the	1

were	1
perfectly	1

that	1

the	1

of	1

as	1
we	1

mount	1

finally	1
descend	1
into	1

all	1

	1

queequeg	1
when	1
the	1

was	1
about	1
half	1
disembowelled	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
stooped	1
over	1
the	1
hatchway	1
and	1
peered	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
there	1
where	1
stripped	1
to	1
his	1
woollen	1
drawers	1
the	1
tattooed	1
savage	1
was	1
crawling	1
about	1
amid	1
that	1
dampness	1
and	1
slime	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
spotted	1
lizard	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
and	1
a	1
well	1
or	1
an	1
ice	1
house	1
it	1
somehow	1
proved	1
to	1
him	1
poor	1
pagan	1
where	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
his	1
sweatings	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
terrible	1
chill	1
which	1
lapsed	1
into	1
a	1
fever	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
some	1
days	1
suffering	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
hammock	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
sill	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
death	1
how	1
he	1
wasted	1
and	1
wasted	1
away	1
in	1
those	1
few	1
long	1
lingering	1
days	1
till	1
there	1
seemed	1
but	1
little	1
left	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
frame	1
and	1
tattooing	1
but	1
as	1
all	1
else	1
in	1
him	1
thinned	1
and	1
his	1
cheek	1
bones	1
grew	1
sharper	1
his	1
eyes	1
nevertheless	1
seemed	1
growing	1
fuller	1
and	1
fuller	1
they	1
became	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
softness	1
of	1
lustre	1
and	1
mildly	1
but	1
deeply	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
you	1
there	1
from	1
his	1
sickness	1
a	1
wondrous	1
testimony	1
to	1
that	1
immortal	1
health	1
in	1
him	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
die	1
or	1
be	1
weakened	1
and	1
like	1
circles	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
as	1
they	1
grow	1
fainter	1
expand	1
so	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
rounding	1
and	1
rounding	1
like	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
eternity	1
an	1
awe	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
named	1
would	1
steal	1
over	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
waning	1
savage	1
and	1
saw	1
as	1
strange	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
any	1
beheld	1
who	1
were	1
bystanders	1
when	1
zoroaster	1
died	1
for	1
whatever	1
is	1
truly	1
wondrous	1
and	1
fearful	1
in	1
man	1
never	1
yet	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
words	1

books	1
and	1
the	1
drawing	1
near	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
alike	1
levels	1
all	1
alike	1
impresses	1
all	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
revelation	1
which	1
only	1
an	1
author	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
could	1
adequately	1
tell	1
so	1
that	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
it	1
again	1
no	1
dying	1
chaldee	1
or	1
greek	1
had	1
higher	1
and	1
holier	1
thoughts	1
than	1
those	1
whose	1
mysterious	1
shades	1
you	1
saw	1
creeping	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
poor	1
queequeg	1
as	1
he	1
quietly	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
swaying	1
hammock	1
and	1
the	1
rolling	1
sea	1
seemed	1
gently	1
rocking	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
final	1
rest	1
and	1
the	1
ocean	1
s	1
invisible	1
flood	1
tide	1
lifted	1
him	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
towards	1
his	1
destined	1
heaven	1
	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
but	1
gave	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
queequeg	1
himself	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
case	1
was	1
forcibly	1
shown	1
by	1
a	1
curious	1
favour	1
he	1
asked	1
he	1
called	1
one	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
grey	1
morning	1
watch	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
just	1
breaking	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
said	1
that	1
while	1
in	1
nantucket	1
he	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
certain	1
little	1
canoes	1
of	1
dark	1
wood	1
like	1
the	1
rich	1
war	1
wood	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
isle	1
and	1
upon	1
inquiry	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
all	1
whalemen	1
who	1
died	1
in	1
nantucket	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1
those	1
same	1
dark	1
canoes	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
fancy	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
laid	1
had	1
much	1
pleased	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
race	1
who	1
after	1
embalming	1
a	1
dead	1
warrior	1
stretched	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
canoe	1
and	1
so	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
floated	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
starry	1
archipelagoes	1
for	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
are	1
isles	1
but	1
that	1
far	1
beyond	1
all	1
visible	1
horizons	1
their	1
own	1
mild	1
uncontinented	1
seas	1
interflow	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
heavens	1
and	1
so	1
form	1
the	1
white	1
breakers	1
of	1
the	1
milky	1
way	1
he	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
hammock	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
sea	1
custom	1
tossed	1
like	1
something	1
vile	1
to	1
the	1
death	1
devouring	1
sharks	1
no	1
he	1
desired	1
a	1
canoe	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
nantucket	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
him	1
being	1
a	1
whaleman	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
whale	1
boat	1
these	1
coffin	1
canoes	1
were	1
without	1
a	1
keel	1
though	1
that	1
involved	1
but	1
uncertain	1
steering	1
and	1
much	1
lee	1
way	1
adown	1
the	1
dim	1
ages	1
	1
now	1
when	1
this	1
strange	1
circumstance	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
aft	1
the	1
carpenter	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
commanded	1
to	1
do	1
queequeg	1
s	1
bidding	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
include	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
heathenish	1
coffin	1
coloured	1
old	1
lumber	1
aboard	1
which	1
upon	1
a	1
long	1
previous	1
voyage	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
from	1
the	1
aboriginal	1
groves	1
of	1
the	1
lackaday	1
islands	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
dark	1
planks	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
recommended	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
no	1
sooner	1
was	1
the	1
carpenter	1
apprised	1
of	1

order	1

taking	1
his	1
rule	1
he	1
forthwith	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
indifferent	1
promptitude	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
proceeded	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1

accuracy	1

the	1

island	1
sailor	1
	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
vice	1
bench	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
convenience	1

and	1
general	1
reference	1
now	1
transferringly	1
measured	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
exact	1
length	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
the	1
transfer	1
permanent	1
by	1
cutting	1
two	1
notches	1
at	1
its	1

this	1
done	1
he	1
marshalled	1

	1

the	1

the	1

duly	1

he	1
lightly	1

the	1

went	1
forward	1
with	1
it	1
inquiring	1
whether	1

were	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
yet	1
in	1
that	1

	1
overhearing	1
the	1

half	1
humorous	1
cries	1
with	1
which	1
the	1

the	1

away	1

there	1
any	1
denying	1
him	1
seeing	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
mortals	1
some	1
dying	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
tyrannical	1
and	1
certainly	1
since	1

little	1

	1
leaning	1
over	1
in	1
his	1

queequeg	1

regarded	1
the	1

with	1
an	1

then	1
called	1
for	1
his	1
harpoon	1
had	1
the	1
wooden	1
stock	1
drawn	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
the	1
iron	1
part	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
along	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
paddles	1
of	1
his	1

all	1
by	1
his	1

were	1
then	1
ranged	1
round	1
the	1
sides	1
within	1
a	1

of	1

was	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1

a	1

of	1

scraped	1
up	1
in	1

at	1

rolled	1
up	1
for	1
a	1

queequeg	1
now	1
entreated	1
to	1
be	1
lifted	1
into	1
his	1

of	1

if	1
any	1
it	1
had	1
he	1
lay	1
without	1

to	1
go	1
to	1

murmured	1
at	1

and	1
signed	1
to	1
be	1
replaced	1
in	1
his	1

	1

him	1
by	1

	1
poor	1

with	1

as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
pip	1
was	1
led	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
replaced	1
in	1
his	1
hammock	1
	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
made	1
every	1
preparation	1
for	1
death	1
now	1
that	1
his	1
coffin	1
was	1
proved	1
a	1
good	1
fit	1
queequeg	1
suddenly	1
rallied	1
soon	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
carpenter	1
s	1
box	1
and	1
thereupon	1
when	1
some	1
expressed	1
their	1
delighted	1
surprise	1
he	1
in	1
substance	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
sudden	1
convalescence	1
was	1
this	1
at	1
a	1
critical	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
recalled	1
a	1
little	1
duty	1
ashore	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
undone	1
and	1
therefore	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
about	1
dying	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
die	1
yet	1
he	1
averred	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
then	1
whether	1
to	1
live	1
or	1
die	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sovereign	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
he	1
answered	1
certainly	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
it	1
was	1
queequeg	1
s	1
conceit	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
live	1
mere	1
sickness	1
could	1
not	1
kill	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
whale	1
or	1
a	1
gale	1
or	1
some	1
violent	1
ungovernable	1
unintelligent	1
destroyer	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
this	1
noteworthy	1
difference	1
between	1
savage	1
and	1
civilized	1
that	1
while	1
a	1
sick	1
civilized	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
six	1
months	1
convalescing	1
generally	1
speaking	1
a	1
sick	1
savage	1
is	1
almost	1
half	1
well	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
so	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
my	1
queequeg	1
gained	1
strength	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
after	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
windlass	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
indolent	1
days	1
but	1
eating	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
appetite	1
he	1
suddenly	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
threw	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
good	1
stretching	1
yawned	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
and	1
then	1
springing	1
into	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
hoisted	1
boat	1
and	1
poising	1
a	1
harpoon	1
pronounced	1
himself	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
fight	1
	1
with	1
a	1
wild	1
whimsiness	1
he	1
now	1
used	1
his	1
coffin	1
for	1
a	1
sea	1
chest	1
and	1
emptying	1
into	1
it	1
his	1
canvas	1
bag	1
of	1
clothes	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
there	1
many	1
spare	1
hours	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
carving	1
the	1
lid	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
grotesque	1
figures	1
and	1
drawings	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
hereby	1
he	1
was	1
striving	1
in	1
his	1
rude	1
way	1
to	1
copy	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
twisted	1
tattooing	1
on	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
this	1
tattooing	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
departed	1
prophet	1
and	1
seer	1
of	1
his	1
island	1
who	1
by	1
those	1
hieroglyphic	1
marks	1
had	1
written	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
body	1
a	1
complete	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
a	1
mystical	1
treatise	1
on	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
attaining	1
truth	1
so	1
that	1
queequeg	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
person	1
was	1
a	1
riddle	1
to	1
unfold	1
a	1
wondrous	1
work	1
in	1
one	1
volume	1
but	1
whose	1
mysteries	1
not	1
even	1
himself	1
could	1
read	1
though	1
his	1
own	1
live	1
heart	1
beat	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
these	1
mysteries	1
were	1
therefore	1
destined	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
to	1
moulder	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
parchment	1
whereon	1
they	1
were	1
inscribed	1
and	1
so	1
be	1
unsolved	1
to	1
the	1

and	1
this	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
which	1
suggested	1
to	1

by	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1

in	1
a	1

as	1
that	1
of	1

the	1

knew	1
that	1
to	1

out	1
of	1

can	1
make	1
one	1

will	1
point	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
any	1
	1
abashed	1

of	1
servile	1

looked	1

knocked	1
off	1

and	1
then	1
handing	1
to	1
the	1
mate	1
the	1

remaining	1
bade	1
him	1
hold	1
it	1

placed	1
the	1
blunted	1

endwise	1
on	1
the	1

of	1
it	1
and	1
less	1

hammered	1
that	1
several	1

holding	1

before	1

going	1
through	1
some	1

with	1
it	1
whether	1
indispensable	1
to	1
the	1

of	1

merely	1
intended	1
to	1

out	1

round	1
quivering	1

vibrating	1
at	1
either	1

at	1

it	1
settled	1
to	1
its	1
place	1
when	1
ahab	1

been	1
intently	1

for	1
this	1

stepped	1
frankly	1
back	1
from	1
the	1

pointing	1
his	1
stretched	1

towards	1
it	1
exclaimed	1

slunk	1
away	1

through	1

riotous	1
and	1

scene	1
	1
at	1

when	1
the	1

drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1

as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
the	1

fishing	1
ground	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
darkness	1
that	1
goes	1
before	1
the	1

was	1
sailing	1
by	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
rocky	1
islets	1
the	1
watch	1
then	1
headed	1
by	1
flask	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
cry	1
so	1
plaintively	1
wild	1
and	1
unearthly	1
like	1
half	1
articulated	1
wailings	1
of	1
the	1
ghosts	1
of	1
all	1
herod	1
s	1
murdered	1
innocents	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
started	1
from	1
their	1
reveries	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
moments	1
stood	1
or	1
sat	1
or	1
leaned	1
all	1
transfixedly	1
listening	1
like	1
the	1
carved	1
roman	1
slave	1
while	1
that	1
wild	1
cry	1
remained	1
within	1
hearing	1
the	1
christian	1
or	1
civilized	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
mermaids	1
and	1
shuddered	1
but	1
the	1
pagan	1
harpooneers	1
remained	1
unappalled	1
yet	1
the	1
grey	1
manxman	1
the	1
oldest	1
mariner	1
of	1
all	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
wild	1
thrilling	1
sounds	1
that	1
were	1
heard	1
were	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
newly	1
drowned	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
below	1
in	1
his	1
hammock	1
ahab	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
this	1
till	1
grey	1
dawn	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
recounted	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
flask	1
not	1
unaccompanied	1
with	1
hinted	1
dark	1
meanings	1
he	1
hollowly	1
laughed	1
and	1
thus	1
explained	1
the	1
wonder	1
	1
those	1
rocky	1
islands	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
passed	1
were	1
the	1
resort	1
of	1
great	1
numbers	1
of	1
seals	1
and	1
some	1
young	1
seals	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
dams	1
or	1
some	1
dams	1
that	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
cubs	1
must	1
have	1
risen	1
nigh	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
kept	1
company	1
with	1
her	1
crying	1
and	1
sobbing	1
with	1
their	1
human	1
sort	1
of	1
wail	1
but	1
this	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
affected	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
because	1
most	1
mariners	1
cherish	1
a	1
very	1
superstitious	1
feeling	1
about	1
seals	1
arising	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
their	1
peculiar	1
tones	1
when	1
in	1
distress	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
human	1
look	1
of	1
their	1
round	1
heads	1
and	1
semi	1
intelligent	1
faces	1
seen	1
peeringly	1
uprising	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
alongside	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
under	1
certain	1
circumstances	1
seals	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
been	1
mistaken	1
for	1
men	1
	1
but	1
the	1
bodings	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
were	1
destined	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
most	1
plausible	1
confirmation	1
in	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
that	1
morning	1
at	1
sun	1
rise	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
from	1
his	1
hammock	1
to	1
his	1
mast	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
fore	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
half	1
waked	1
from	1
his	1
sleep	1
for	1
sailors	1
sometimes	1
go	1
aloft	1
in	1
a	1
transition	1
state	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
no	1
telling	1
but	1
be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
at	1
his	1
perch	1
when	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
a	1
rushing	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
falling	1
phantom	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
a	1
little	1
tossed	1
heap	1
of	1
white	1
bubbles	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
the	1
life	1

a	1
long	1
slender	1
cask	1
was	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
stern	1
where	1
it	1
always	1
hung	1
obedient	1
to	1
a	1
cunning	1
spring	1
but	1
no	1
hand	1
rose	1
to	1
seize	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
having	1
long	1
beat	1
upon	1
this	1
cask	1
it	1
had	1
shrunken	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
slowly	1
filled	1
and	1
that	1
parched	1
wood	1
also	1
filled	1
at	1
its	1
every	1
pore	1
and	1
the	1
studded	1
iron	1
bound	1
cask	1
followed	1
the	1
sailor	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
yield	1
him	1
his	1
pillow	1
though	1
in	1
sooth	1
but	1
a	1
hard	1
one	1
	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
pequod	1
that	1
mounted	1
the	1
mast	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
on	1
the	1
white	1

s	1
own	1
peculiar	1
ground	1
that	1
man	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1

few	1
perhaps	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
indeed	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
grieved	1
at	1
this	1
event	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
a	1
portent	1
for	1
they	1
regarded	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
foreshadowing	1
of	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
an	1
evil	1
already	1
presaged	1
they	1
declared	1
that	1
now	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
those	1
wild	1
shrieks	1
they	1
had	1

be	1

the	1

late	1
on	1

three	1
of	1

were	1
engaged	1
with	1
a	1
shoal	1
of	1
whales	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
some	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
in	1
swift	1
chase	1
to	1
windward	1
the	1
white	1
hump	1
and	1
head	1
of	1

had	1
suddenly	1
loomed	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

not	1
very	1
far	1
to	1

whereupon	1
the	1

instantly	1
lowered	1
in	1
chase	1

before	1
the	1

this	1
fourth	1
boat	1
the	1
swiftest	1
keeled	1
of	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
fastening	1
at	1

as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
mast	1

could	1
tell	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1

diminished	1
dotted	1
boat	1

then	1
a	1
swift	1
gleam	1
of	1
bubbling	1
white	1
water	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
nothing	1
more	1
whence	1
it	1
was	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
stricken	1
whale	1
must	1
have	1
indefinitely	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
his	1

up	1

three	1

of	1

in	1

the	1

been	1
necessitated	1
to	1
leave	1
that	1

to	1
its	1
fate	1
till	1
near	1
midnight	1

for	1
the	1

to	1

her	1

from	1
it	1

the	1

him	1
that	1
the	1

looked	1
dubious	1
at	1
him	1
half	1
uncertain	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
whether	1
indeed	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
mortal	1

or	1
else	1
a	1
tremulous	1
shadow	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1

by	1
some	1
unseen	1
being	1

still	1
for	1
hours	1

never	1
sat	1

leaned	1
his	1
wan	1

wondrous	1
eyes	1
did	1
plainly	1
say	1
we	1
two	1
watchmen	1
never	1
rest	1
	1
nor	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
by	1
night	1

day	1
could	1
the	1
mariners	1
now	1
step	1
upon	1
the	1

ahab	1
was	1
before	1
them	1
either	1
standing	1
in	1
his	1
pivot	1

exactly	1
pacing	1

two	1
undeviating	1
limits	1
the	1

the	1

him	1
standing	1
in	1

his	1
living	1
foot	1
advanced	1
upon	1
the	1

as	1

slouched	1

over	1

beneath	1
that	1

they	1
could	1
never	1

unerringly	1
whether	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
his	1

were	1
really	1
closed	1
at	1

whether	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
intently	1
scanning	1

stood	1
so	1
in	1

for	1
a	1

upon	1

so	1
day	1
after	1

night	1
after	1

he	1
went	1
no	1
more	1
beneath	1
the	1

whatever	1
he	1
wanted	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
that	1
thing	1

sent	1
for	1
	1

ate	1
in	1
the	1

that	1
is	1
his	1
two	1
only	1
meals	1
breakfast	1
and	1
dinner	1
supper	1
he	1
never	1
touched	1
nor	1
reaped	1
his	1
beard	1
which	1
darkly	1
grew	1
all	1
gnarled	1
as	1
unearthed	1
roots	1
of	1
trees	1
blown	1
over	1
which	1
still	1
grow	1
idly	1
on	1
at	1
naked	1
base	1
though	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1

though	1
his	1
whole	1

was	1
now	1
become	1
one	1
watch	1
on	1

though	1
the	1

was	1
without	1

at	1
long	1

some	1

it	1

to	1

the	1

openly	1

to	1
the	1

at	1

for	1

in	1

parsee	1
by	1

still	1

gazing	1
upon	1

in	1

forethrown	1

in	1

the	1

in	1

as	1
daily	1
hourly	1

every	1

at	1

of	1
nearly	1

whether	1

might	1
not	1

overlook	1
the	1

if	1

must	1
have	1
the	1

with	1
his	1

he	1
rigged	1
a	1
nest	1
of	1
basketed	1
bowlines	1
and	1
sending	1
a	1
hand	1
aloft	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
sheaved	1
block	1
to	1
secure	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
mast	1
head	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
downward	1
reeved	1
rope	1
and	1
attaching	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
basket	1
prepared	1
a	1
pin	1
for	1
the	1

end	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
fasten	1
it	1
at	1
the	1

this	1
done	1
with	1
that	1
end	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
pin	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
upon	1
his	1

sweeping	1
from	1

pausing	1
his	1
glance	1
long	1
upon	1
daggoo	1

shunning	1

and	1
then	1
settling	1
his	1
firm	1
relying	1
eye	1
upon	1
the	1
chief	1
mate	1
said	1
take	1
the	1
rope	1
sir	1
i	1
give	1
it	1
into	1
thy	1

then	1
arranging	1
his	1
person	1
in	1
the	1

he	1
gave	1
the	1
word	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
hoist	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
perch	1
starbuck	1
being	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
secured	1
the	1
rope	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
afterwards	1
stood	1
near	1
it	1
and	1
thus	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
clinging	1
round	1
the	1
royal	1
mast	1
ahab	1
gazed	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
miles	1
and	1
miles	1
ahead	1
astern	1

that	1
within	1
the	1
wide	1
expanded	1
circle	1
commanded	1
at	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
height	1
	1
when	1
in	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
some	1
lofty	1
almost	1
isolated	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
rigging	1
which	1
chances	1
to	1
afford	1
no	1
foothold	1
the	1
sailor	1
at	1
sea	1
is	1
hoisted	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
spot	1

by	1

under	1
these	1
circumstances	1
its	1
fastened	1
end	1
on	1
deck	1
is	1
always	1
given	1
in	1
strict	1
charge	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
special	1
watch	1
of	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
wilderness	1
of	1
running	1
rigging	1
whose	1
various	1
different	1
relations	1
aloft	1
cannot	1
always	1
be	1
infallibly	1
discerned	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
deck	1
ends	1
of	1
these	1
ropes	1
are	1
being	1
every	1
few	1
minutes	1
cast	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
fastenings	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
natural	1
fatality	1
if	1
unprovided	1
with	1
a	1
constant	1
watchman	1
the	1
hoisted	1
sailor	1
should	1
by	1
some	1
carelessness	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
be	1
cast	1
adrift	1
and	1
fall	1
all	1
swooping	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
so	1
ahab	1
s	1
proceedings	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
were	1
not	1
unusual	1
the	1
only	1
strange	1
thing	1
about	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
starbuck	1
almost	1
the	1
one	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
ventured	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
with	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
degree	1
approaching	1
to	1
decision	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
too	1
whose	1
faithfulness	1
on	1
the	1
look	1
out	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
doubt	1
somewhat	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
he	1
should	1
select	1
for	1
his	1
watchman	1
freely	1
giving	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
into	1
such	1
an	1
otherwise	1
distrusted	1
person	1
s	1
hands	1
	1
now	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
ahab	1
was	1
perched	1
aloft	1
ere	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
ten	1
minutes	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
red	1
billed	1
savage	1
sea	1
hawks	1
which	1
so	1
often	1
fly	1
incommodiously	1
close	1
round	1
the	1
manned	1
mast	1
heads	1
of	1
whalemen	1
in	1
these	1
latitudes	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
birds	1
came	1
wheeling	1
and	1
screaming	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
maze	1
of	1
untrackably	1
swift	1
circlings	1
then	1
it	1
darted	1
a	1
thousand	1
feet	1
straight	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
then	1
spiralized	1
downwards	1
and	1
went	1
eddying	1
again	1
round	1
his	1
head	1
	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
distant	1
horizon	1
ahab	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
mark	1
this	1
wild	1
bird	1
nor	1
indeed	1
would	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
have	1
marked	1
it	1
much	1
it	1
being	1
no	1
uncommon	1
circumstance	1
only	1
now	1
almost	1
the	1
least	1
heedful	1
eye	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
cunning	1
meaning	1

almost	1
every	1

cried	1
the	1

who	1

posted	1
at	1
the	1
mizen	1
mast	1
head	1
stood	1
directly	1
behind	1
ahab	1

somewhat	1
lower	1
than	1
his	1
level	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
gulf	1
of	1
air	1
dividing	1
them	1
	1

already	1

at	1

with	1
a	1
scream	1
the	1

darted	1
away	1
with	1
his	1

flew	1
thrice	1
round	1

removing	1
his	1

to	1

it	1
and	1
thereupon	1
tanaquil	1
his	1

declared	1
that	1

would	1
be	1

only	1
by	1

the	1

flew	1
on	1

on	1
with	1
it	1
far	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
prow	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
disappeared	1

from	1

a	1

heedlessly	1

around	1

with	1
the	1
circle	1

	1
slowly	1
crossing	1
the	1
deck	1
from	1
the	1
scuttle	1
ahab	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
side	1

watched	1
how	1
his	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
sank	1
and	1
sank	1
to	1
his	1
gaze	1
the	1
more	1

the	1
more	1
that	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
pierce	1
the	1
profundity	1

the	1
lovely	1

in	1
that	1

at	1

seem	1
to	1
dispel	1

in	1
his	1
soul	1
that	1
glad	1
happy	1
air	1
that	1
winsome	1

at	1

stroke	1
and	1
caress	1
him	1
the	1
step	1

so	1
long	1
cruel	1
forbidding	1
now	1
threw	1
affectionate	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
stubborn	1
neck	1
and	1
did	1
seem	1
to	1
joyously	1
sob	1
over	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
over	1
one	1

to	1
bless	1
from	1
beneath	1

ahab	1
dropped	1
a	1

into	1
the	1

in	1

measureless	1
sobbing	1
that	1
stole	1
out	1

on	1
either	1

moved	1
on	1
still	1
withholding	1
from	1

the	1
full	1
terrors	1
of	1
his	1
submerged	1
trunk	1
entirely	1
hiding	1
the	1
wrenched	1
hideousness	1
of	1
his	1

soon	1
the	1
fore	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
slowly	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
whole	1
marbleized	1
body	1
formed	1
a	1
high	1
arch	1
like	1
virginia	1

and	1
warningly	1
waving	1
his	1

in	1
the	1

the	1

god	1
revealed	1

sounded	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1

hoveringly	1
halting	1
and	1
dipping	1
on	1
the	1
wing	1
the	1
white	1

longingly	1
lingered	1
over	1
the	1

left	1
	1
with	1
oars	1

and	1

down	1
the	1

of	1
their	1

the	1

standing	1
rooted	1
in	1
his	1

he	1
gazed	1
beyond	1
the	1

place	1
towards	1
the	1
dim	1
blue	1
spaces	1
and	1
wide	1
wooing	1
vacancies	1
to	1
leeward	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
for	1
again	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
whirling	1
round	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
swept	1
the	1
watery	1
circle	1
the	1
breeze	1
now	1
freshened	1
the	1
sea	1
began	1
to	1
swell	1
	1

	1
in	1
long	1

as	1
when	1

the	1

were	1
now	1
all	1
flying	1
towards	1
ahab	1

and	1
when	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
began	1
fluttering	1
over	1
the	1
water	1
there	1
wheeling	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
with	1
joyous	1
expectant	1
cries	1
their	1
vision	1
was	1
keener	1
than	1
man	1
s	1
ahab	1
could	1
discover	1
no	1
sign	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
but	1
suddenly	1
as	1
he	1
peered	1
down	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
depths	1
he	1
profoundly	1
saw	1
a	1
white	1
living	1
spot	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
white	1
weasel	1
with	1
wonderful	1
celerity	1
uprising	1
and	1
magnifying	1
as	1
it	1
rose	1
till	1
it	1
turned	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
were	1
plainly	1
revealed	1
two	1
long	1
crooked	1
rows	1
of	1
white	1
glistening	1
teeth	1
floating	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
undiscoverable	1
bottom	1
it	1
was	1
moby	1
dick	1
s	1
open	1
mouth	1
and	1
scrolled	1

his	1
vast	1
shadowed	1
bulk	1
still	1
half	1
blending	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
glittering	1
mouth	1
yawned	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat	1
like	1
an	1
open	1
doored	1
marble	1
tomb	1
and	1
giving	1
one	1
sidelong	1
sweep	1
with	1
his	1
steering	1
oar	1
ahab	1
whirled	1
the	1
craft	1
aside	1
from	1
this	1
tremendous	1
apparition	1
then	1
calling	1
upon	1
fedallah	1
to	1
change	1
places	1
with	1
him	1
went	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
seizing	1
perth	1
s	1
harpoon	1
commanded	1
his	1
crew	1
to	1
grasp	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
stern	1
	1
now	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
timely	1
spinning	1
round	1
the	1
boat	1
upon	1
its	1
axis	1
its	1
bow	1
by	1
anticipation	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
head	1
while	1
yet	1
under	1
water	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
perceiving	1
this	1
stratagem	1
moby	1
dick	1
with	1
that	1
malicious	1
intelligence	1
ascribed	1
to	1
him	1
sidelingly	1
transplanted	1
himself	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
shooting	1
his	1
pleated	1
head	1
lengthwise	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat	1
	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
through	1
every	1
plank	1
and	1
each	1
rib	1
it	1
thrilled	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
whale	1
obliquely	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
biting	1
shark	1
slowly	1
and	1
feelingly	1
taking	1
its	1
bows	1
full	1
within	1
his	1
mouth	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
long	1
narrow	1
scrolled	1
lower	1
jaw	1
curled	1
high	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
teeth	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
lock	1
the	1
bluish	1
pearl	1
white	1
of	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
jaw	1
was	1
within	1
six	1
inches	1
of	1
ahab	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
reached	1
higher	1
than	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
attitude	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
now	1
shook	1
the	1
slight	1
cedar	1
as	1
a	1
mildly	1
cruel	1
cat	1
her	1
mouse	1
with	1
unastonished	1
eyes	1
fedallah	1
gazed	1
and	1
crossed	1
his	1
arms	1
but	1
the	1
tiger	1
yellow	1
crew	1
were	1
tumbling	1
over	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
heads	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
uttermost	1
stern	1
	1
and	1
now	1
while	1
both	1
elastic	1
gunwales	1
were	1
springing	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
dallied	1
with	1
the	1
doomed	1
craft	1
in	1
this	1
devilish	1
way	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
being	1
submerged	1
beneath	1
the	1
boat	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
darted	1
at	1
from	1
the	1
bows	1
for	1
the	1
bows	1
were	1
almost	1
inside	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
involuntarily	1
paused	1
as	1
before	1
a	1
quick	1
crisis	1
impossible	1
to	1
withstand	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
monomaniac	1
ahab	1
furious	1
with	1
this	1
tantalizing	1
vicinity	1
of	1
his	1
foe	1
which	1
placed	1
him	1
all	1
alive	1
and	1
helpless	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
jaws	1
he	1
hated	1
frenzied	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
seized	1
the	1
long	1
bone	1
with	1
his	1
naked	1
hands	1
and	1
wildly	1
strove	1
to	1
wrench	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
gripe	1
as	1
now	1
he	1
thus	1
vainly	1
strove	1
the	1
jaw	1
slipped	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
frail	1
gunwales	1
bent	1
in	1
collapsed	1
and	1
snapped	1
as	1
both	1
jaws	1
like	1
an	1
enormous	1
shears	1
sliding	1
further	1
aft	1
bit	1
the	1
craft	1
completely	1
in	1
twain	1
and	1
locked	1
themselves	1
fast	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
midway	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
floating	1
wrecks	1
these	1
floated	1
aside	1
the	1
broken	1
ends	1
drooping	1
the	1
crew	1
at	1
the	1
stern	1
wreck	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
gunwales	1
and	1
striving	1
to	1
hold	1
fast	1
to	1
the	1
oars	1
to	1
lash	1
them	1
across	1
	1
at	1
that	1
preluding	1
moment	1
ere	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
yet	1
snapped	1
ahab	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
perceive	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
intent	1
by	1
the	1
crafty	1
upraising	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
movement	1
that	1
loosed	1
his	1
hold	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
his	1
hand	1
had	1
made	1
one	1
final	1
effort	1
to	1
push	1
the	1
boat	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bite	1
but	1
only	1
slipping	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
mouth	1
and	1
tilting	1
over	1
sideways	1
as	1
it	1
slipped	1
the	1
boat	1
had	1
shaken	1
off	1
his	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
jaw	1
spilled	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
to	1
the	1
push	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
fell	1
flat	1
faced	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
ripplingly	1
withdrawing	1
from	1
his	1
prey	1
moby	1
dick	1
now	1
lay	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
vertically	1
thrusting	1
his	1
oblong	1
white	1
head	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
billows	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
slowly	1
revolving	1
his	1
whole	1
spindled	1
body	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
vast	1
wrinkled	1
forehead	1
rose	1
some	1
twenty	1
or	1
more	1
feet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
the	1
now	1
rising	1
swells	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
confluent	1
waves	1
dazzlingly	1
broke	1
against	1
it	1
vindictively	1
tossing	1
their	1
shivered	1
spray	1
still	1
higher	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
gale	1
the	1
but	1
half	1
baffled	1
channel	1
billows	1
only	1
recoil	1
from	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
eddystone	1
triumphantly	1
to	1
overleap	1
its	1
summit	1
with	1
their	1
scud	1
	1
	1
this	1
motion	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
sperm	1
whale	1
it	1
receives	1
its	1
designation	1
pitchpoling	1
from	1
its	1
being	1
likened	1
to	1
that	1
preliminary	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
poise	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
lance	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
called	1
pitchpoling	1
previously	1
described	1
by	1
this	1
motion	1
the	1
whale	1
must	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
comprehensively	1
view	1
whatever	1
objects	1
may	1
be	1
encircling	1
him	1
	1
	1
but	1
soon	1
resuming	1
his	1
horizontal	1
attitude	1
moby	1
dick	1
swam	1
swiftly	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
wrecked	1
crew	1
sideways	1
churning	1
the	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
vengeful	1
wake	1
as	1
if	1
lashing	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
still	1
another	1
and	1
more	1
deadly	1
assault	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
splintered	1
boat	1
seemed	1
to	1
madden	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
grapes	1
and	1
mulberries	1
cast	1
before	1
antiochus	1
s	1
elephants	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1

meanwhile	1
ahab	1
half	1
smothered	1
in	1
the	1
foam	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
insolent	1
tail	1
and	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
cripple	1
to	1
swim	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
keep	1
afloat	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
whirlpool	1
as	1
that	1
helpless	1
ahab	1
s	1
head	1
was	1
seen	1
like	1
a	1
tossed	1
bubble	1
which	1
the	1
least	1
chance	1
shock	1
might	1
burst	1
from	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
fragmentary	1
stern	1
fedallah	1
incuriously	1
and	1
mildly	1
eyed	1
him	1
the	1
clinging	1
crew	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
drifting	1
end	1
could	1
not	1
succor	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
was	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
themselves	1
for	1
so	1
revolvingly	1
appalling	1
was	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
aspect	1
and	1
so	1
planetarily	1
swift	1
the	1
ever	1
contracting	1
circles	1
he	1
made	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
horizontally	1
swooping	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
other	1
boats	1
unharmed	1
still	1
hovered	1
hard	1
by	1
still	1
they	1
dared	1
not	1
pull	1
into	1
the	1
eddy	1
to	1
strike	1
lest	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
jeopardized	1
castaways	1
ahab	1
and	1
all	1

in	1
that	1
case	1
could	1
they	1
themselves	1
hope	1
to	1
escape	1
with	1
straining	1
eyes	1
then	1
they	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
direful	1
zone	1

	1

on	1

that	1
moment	1
a	1
breaking	1
sea	1
dashed	1
on	1
him	1
from	1

and	1
whelmed	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
time	1

struggling	1
out	1
of	1

again	1
and	1
chancing	1
to	1

she	1
effectually	1
parted	1
the	1

from	1
his	1
victim	1
as	1
he	1
sullenly	1
swam	1
off	1

a	1

lying	1
all	1
crushed	1
in	1

not	1

the	1

to	1

some	1
one	1
brief	1
vicissitude	1
the	1

itself	1

offered	1
the	1
most	1

of	1
overtaking	1
the	1
chase	1
accordingly	1
the	1
boats	1
now	1
made	1
for	1
her	1

were	1
soon	1
swayed	1
up	1
to	1
their	1

of	1
the	1

stacking	1
her	1

high	1
up	1

thus	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
pacing	1
beneath	1
his	1
slouched	1

at	1

his	1

thing	1
by	1
no	1

unprecedented	1
in	1

is	1
the	1
wonderful	1
skill	1
prescience	1
of	1

invincible	1
confidence	1
acquired	1
by	1
some	1
great	1
natural	1
geniuses	1
among	1
the	1
nantucket	1
commanders	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
simple	1
observation	1
of	1
a	1
whale	1
when	1
last	1
descried	1
they	1
will	1
under	1
certain	1
given	1
circumstances	1
pretty	1
accurately	1
foretell	1
both	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
swim	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
while	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
probable	1
rate	1
of	1
progression	1
during	1
that	1
period	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
somewhat	1
as	1
a	1
pilot	1
when	1
about	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
coast	1
whose	1
general	1
trending	1
he	1
well	1
knows	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
desires	1
shortly	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
again	1
but	1
at	1
some	1
further	1
point	1
like	1
as	1
this	1
pilot	1
stands	1
by	1
his	1
compass	1
and	1
takes	1
the	1
precise	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
cape	1
at	1

aright	1
the	1
remote	1
unseen	1

eventually	1
to	1
be	1
visited	1
so	1
does	1
the	1
fisherman	1
at	1
his	1
compass	1
with	1
the	1
whale	1
for	1
after	1
being	1
chased	1
and	1
diligently	1
marked	1
through	1
several	1
hours	1

by	1
all	1

were	1
bowled	1
along	1
the	1

that	1
made	1

rushed	1
the	1

invisible	1

seemed	1
the	1

ere	1
that	1

all	1

were	1
plain	1
as	1
the	1

three	1
masts	1
to	1
his	1

the	1
white	1

churning	1
himself	1
into	1
furious	1
speed	1
almost	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
rushing	1
among	1
the	1
boats	1
with	1
open	1
jaws	1
and	1
a	1
lashing	1
tail	1
offered	1
appalling	1
battle	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
and	1
heedless	1
of	1
the	1
irons	1
darted	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
boat	1
seemed	1
only	1
intent	1
on	1
annihilating	1
each	1
separate	1
plank	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
boats	1
were	1
made	1
but	1
skilfully	1
manoeuvred	1
incessantly	1
wheeling	1
like	1
trained	1
chargers	1
in	1
the	1

his	1
to	1
shreds	1
	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
his	1
untraceable	1
evolutions	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
so	1
crossed	1
and	1
recrossed	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
entangled	1
the	1
slack	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
lines	1
now	1
fast	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
foreshortened	1
and	1
of	1
themselves	1
warped	1
the	1
devoted	1
boats	1
towards	1
the	1
planted	1
irons	1
in	1
him	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
whale	1
drew	1
aside	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rally	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
tremendous	1
charge	1
seizing	1
that	1
opportunity	1
ahab	1
first	1
paid	1
out	1
more	1
line	1
and	1
then	1
was	1
rapidly	1
hauling	1
and	1
jerking	1
in	1
upon	1
it	1
again	1
hoping	1
that	1
way	1
to	1
disencumber	1
it	1
of	1
some	1
snarls	1
when	1
lo	1
a	1
sight	1
more	1
savage	1
than	1
the	1
embattled	1
teeth	1
of	1
sharks	1
	1
caught	1
and	1
twisted	1
corkscrewed	1
in	1
the	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
loose	1
harpoons	1
and	1
lances	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
bristling	1
barbs	1
and	1
points	1
came	1
flashing	1
and	1
dripping	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chocks	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
ahab	1
s	1
boat	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
seizing	1
the	1
boat	1
knife	1
he	1
critically	1
reached	1
within	1
through	1
and	1
then	1
without	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
steel	1
dragged	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
beyond	1
passed	1
it	1
inboard	1
to	1
the	1
bowsman	1
and	1
then	1
twice	1
sundering	1
the	1
rope	1
near	1
the	1
chocks	1
dropped	1
the	1
intercepted	1
fagot	1
of	1
steel	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
fast	1
again	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
made	1
a	1
sudden	1
rush	1
among	1
the	1
remaining	1
tangles	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
lines	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
irresistibly	1
dragged	1
the	1
more	1
involved	1
boats	1
of	1
stubb	1
and	1
flask	1
towards	1
his	1
flukes	1
dashed	1
them	1
together	1
like	1
two	1
rolling	1
husks	1
on	1
a	1
surf	1
beaten	1
beach	1
and	1
then	1
diving	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
disappeared	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
maelstrom	1
in	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
the	1
odorous	1
cedar	1
chips	1
of	1
the	1
wrecks	1
danced	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
like	1
the	1
grated	1
nutmeg	1
in	1
a	1
swiftly	1
stirred	1
bowl	1
of	1
punch	1
	1
while	1
the	1
two	1
crews	1
were	1
yet	1
circling	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
reaching	1
out	1
after	1
the	1
revolving	1

tubs	1

floating	1
furniture	1
while	1
aslope	1
little	1
flask	1
bobbed	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
like	1
an	1
empty	1
vial	1
twitching	1
his	1
legs	1
upwards	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
dreaded	1
jaws	1
of	1
sharks	1
and	1
stubb	1
was	1
lustily	1
singing	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
one	1
to	1
ladle	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
man	1

now	1
parting	1
admitted	1
of	1
his	1
pulling	1
into	1
the	1
creamy	1
pool	1
to	1
rescue	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
that	1
wild	1
simultaneousness	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
concreted	1
perils	1
ahab	1
s	1
yet	1
unstricken	1
boat	1
seemed	1
drawn	1
up	1
towards	1
heaven	1
by	1
invisible	1
wires	1
as	1
arrow	1
like	1
shooting	1
perpendicularly	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
dashed	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead	1
against	1
its	1
bottom	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
turning	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
till	1
it	1
fell	1
again	1
gunwale	1
downwards	1
and	1
ahab	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
struggled	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
it	1
like	1
seals	1
from	1
a	1
sea	1
side	1
cave	1
	1
the	1
first	1
uprising	1
momentum	1
of	1
the	1
whale	1
modifying	1
its	1
direction	1
as	1
he	1
struck	1
the	1
surface	1
involuntarily	1
launched	1
him	1
along	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
destruction	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
now	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
slowly	1
feeling	1
with	1
his	1
flukes	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
and	1
whenever	1
a	1
stray	1
oar	1
bit	1
of	1
plank	1
the	1
least	1
chip	1
or	1
crumb	1
of	1
the	1
boats	1
touched	1
his	1
skin	1
his	1
tail	1
swiftly	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
came	1
sideways	1
smiting	1
the	1
sea	1
but	1
soon	1
as	1
if	1
satisfied	1
that	1
his	1
work	1
for	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
done	1
he	1
pushed	1
his	1
pleated	1
forehead	1
through	1
the	1
ocean	1
and	1
trailing	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
intertangled	1
lines	1
continued	1
his	1
leeward	1
way	1
at	1
a	1
traveller	1

methodic	1
pace	1
	1
as	1
before	1
the	1
attentive	1
ship	1
having	1
descried	1
the	1
whole	1
fight	1
again	1
came	1
bearing	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
and	1
dropping	1
a	1
boat	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
floating	1
mariners	1

whatever	1
else	1
could	1
be	1
caught	1

on	1
her	1

some	1
sprained	1

livid	1
contusions	1
wrenched	1
harpoons	1

inextricable	1

tossing	1

from	1
him	1

by	1
the	1

	1
in	1
an	1

the	1

was	1
pulling	1
round	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
stern	1
	1
the	1
sharks	1
the	1
sharks	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1

there	1
o	1
master	1
my	1
master	1
come	1
back	1
	1

ahab	1
heard	1
nothing	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
was	1
high	1
lifted	1
then	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
leaped	1
on	1
	1
yet	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
true	1
for	1
scarce	1
had	1
he	1
pushed	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
when	1
numbers	1
of	1
sharks	1
seemingly	1
rising	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
dark	1
waters	1
beneath	1
the	1
hull	1
maliciously	1
snapped	1
at	1
the	1
blades	1
of	1
the	1
oars	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
dipped	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
accompanied	1
the	1
boat	1
with	1
their	1
bites	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
happening	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
boats	1
in	1
those	1
swarming	1
seas	1
the	1
sharks	1
at	1
times	1
apparently	1
following	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
prescient	1
way	1
that	1
vultures	1
hover	1
over	1
the	1
banners	1
of	1
marching	1
regiments	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
sharks	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
observed	1
by	1
the	1
pequod	1
since	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
had	1
been	1
first	1
descried	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
ahab	1
s	1
crew	1
were	1
all	1
such	1
tiger	1
yellow	1
barbarians	1
and	1
therefore	1
their	1
flesh	1
more	1
musky	1
to	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
the	1
sharks	1
a	1
matter	1
sometimes	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
affect	1
them	1
however	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
follow	1
that	1
one	1
boat	1
without	1
molesting	1
the	1
others	1
	1
heart	1
of	1
wrought	1
steel	1
murmured	1
starbuck	1
gazing	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
following	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
receding	1
boat	1
canst	1
thou	1
yet	1
ring	1
boldly	1
to	1
that	1
sight	1
lowering	1
thy	1
keel	1
among	1
ravening	1
sharks	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
them	1
open	1
mouthed	1
to	1
the	1
chase	1
and	1
this	1
the	1
critical	1
third	1

from	1

sounded	1

intending	1
to	1
be	1

him	1
at	1

held	1
on	1

a	1
little	1
sideways	1
from	1
the	1
vessel	1
the	1
becharmed	1

as	1

from	1

berg	1
of	1
ice	1
swiftly	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
a	1
low	1
rumbling	1
sound	1
was	1
heard	1

subterraneous	1
hum	1

then	1
all	1
held	1
their	1
breaths	1
as	1
bedraggled	1
with	1
trailing	1
ropes	1

obliquely	1
from	1

in	1
a	1
thin	1

hovered	1
for	1

in	1

from	1

white	1

beneath	1
the	1

looked	1
knitted	1
together	1
as	1

he	1
came	1
churning	1
his	1
tail	1
among	1
the	1

once	1

apart	1
spilling	1
out	1
the	1

from	1

out	1

showed	1
one	1
entire	1

up	1

the	1

gone	1
down	1
again	1
	1

he	1
looked	1
too	1
nigh	1
the	1

for	1
as	1
if	1
bent	1
upon	1
escaping	1
with	1
the	1
corpse	1
he	1

as	1
if	1
the	1

had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
stage	1
in	1
his	1
leeward	1
voyage	1
moby	1
dick	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
steadily	1
swimming	1
forward	1
and	1
had	1
almost	1
passed	1
the	1
ship	1
which	1
thus	1
far	1
had	1
been	1
sailing	1
in	1
the	1
contrary	1
direction	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
her	1
headway	1
had	1
been	1
stopped	1
he	1
seemed	1
swimming	1
with	1
his	1
utmost	1
velocity	1
and	1
now	1
only	1
intent	1
upon	1
pursuing	1
his	1
own	1
straight	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
	1
oh	1
ahab	1
cried	1
starbuck	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
is	1
it	1
even	1
now	1
the	1
third	1

to	1

seeks	1
thee	1
not	1

thou	1
thou	1
that	1
madly	1
seekest	1
him	1
	1
setting	1
sail	1
to	1
the	1
rising	1
wind	1
the	1
lonely	1
boat	1
was	1
swiftly	1
impelled	1
to	1
leeward	1
by	1
both	1
oars	1
and	1
canvas	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
when	1
ahab	1
was	1
sliding	1
by	1
the	1
vessel	1
so	1
near	1
as	1
plainly	1
to	1
distinguish	1
starbuck	1
s	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
rail	1
he	1
hailed	1
him	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
vessel	1
about	1
and	1
follow	1
him	1
not	1
too	1
swiftly	1
at	1
a	1
judicious	1
interval	1
glancing	1
upwards	1
he	1
saw	1
tashtego	1
queequeg	1
and	1
daggoo	1
eagerly	1
mounting	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
mast	1
heads	1
while	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
were	1
rocking	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
staved	1
boats	1
which	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
been	1
hoisted	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
were	1
busily	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
repairing	1
them	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
through	1
the	1
port	1
holes	1
as	1
he	1
sped	1
he	1
also	1
caught	1
flying	1
glimpses	1
of	1
stubb	1
and	1
flask	1
busying	1
themselves	1
on	1
deck	1
among	1
bundles	1
of	1
new	1
irons	1
and	1
lances	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
hammers	1
in	1
the	1
broken	1
boats	1
far	1
other	1
hammers	1
seemed	1
driving	1
a	1
nail	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
he	1
rallied	1
and	1
now	1
marking	1
that	1
the	1
vane	1
or	1
flag	1
was	1
gone	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
mast	1
head	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
tashtego	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
gained	1
that	1
perch	1
to	1
descend	1
again	1
for	1
another	1
flag	1
and	1
a	1
hammer	1
and	1
nails	1
and	1
so	1
nail	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mast	1
	1
whether	1
fagged	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
running	1
chase	1
and	1
the	1
resistance	1
to	1
his	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
knotted	1
hamper	1
he	1
bore	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
latent	1
deceitfulness	1
and	1
malice	1
in	1
him	1
whichever	1
was	1
true	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
way	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
abate	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
from	1
the	1
boat	1
so	1
rapidly	1
nearing	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
though	1
indeed	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
last	1
start	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
ahab	1
glided	1
over	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
unpitying	1
sharks	1
accompanied	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
pertinaciously	1
stuck	1
to	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
so	1
continually	1
bit	1
at	1
the	1
plying	1
oars	1
that	1
the	1
blades	1
became	1
jagged	1
and	1
crunched	1
and	1
left	1
small	1
splinters	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
at	1
almost	1
every	1
dip	1
	1
heed	1
them	1
not	1
those	1
teeth	1
but	1
give	1
new	1
rowlocks	1
to	1
your	1
oars	1
pull	1
on	1
tis	1
the	1
better	1
rest	1
the	1
shark	1
s	1
jaw	1
than	1
the	1
yielding	1
water	1
	1
but	1
at	1
every	1
bite	1
sir	1
the	1
thin	1
blades	1
grow	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller	1
	1
they	1
will	1
last	1
long	1
enough	1
pull	1
on	1
but	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
he	1
muttered	1
whether	1
these	1
sharks	1
swim	1
to	1
feast	1
on	1
the	1
whale	1
or	1
on	1
ahab	1
but	1
pull	1
on	1
aye	1
all	1
alive	1
now	1
we	1
near	1
him	1
the	1
helm	1
take	1
the	1
helm	1
let	1
me	1
pass	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
helped	1
him	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
still	1
flying	1
boat	1
	1
at	1
length	1
as	1
the	1
craft	1
was	1
cast	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
ran	1
ranging	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
s	1
flank	1
he	1
seemed	1
strangely	1
oblivious	1
of	1
its	1
advance	1
as	1
the	1
whale	1
sometimes	1
will	1
and	1
ahab	1
was	1
fairly	1
within	1
the	1
smoky	1
mountain	1
mist	1
which	1
thrown	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
whale	1
s	1
spout	1
curled	1
round	1
his	1
great	1
monadnock	1
hump	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
thus	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
with	1
body	1
arched	1
back	1
and	1
both	1
arms	1
lengthwise	1
high	1
lifted	1
to	1
the	1
poise	1
he	1
darted	1
his	1
fierce	1
iron	1
and	1
his	1
far	1
fiercer	1
curse	1
into	1
the	1
hated	1
whale	1
as	1
both	1
steel	1
and	1
curse	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
socket	1
as	1
if	1
sucked	1
into	1
a	1
morass	1
moby	1
dick	1
sideways	1
writhed	1
spasmodically	1
rolled	1
his	1
nigh	1
flank	1
against	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
without	1
staving	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
suddenly	1
canted	1
the	1
boat	1
over	1
that	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
elevated	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
gunwale	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
then	1
clung	1
ahab	1
would	1
once	1
more	1
have	1
been	1
tossed	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
oarsmen	1
who	1
foreknew	1
not	1
the	1
precise	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
dart	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
unprepared	1
for	1
its	1
effects	1
these	1
were	1
flung	1
out	1
but	1
so	1
fell	1
that	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
clutched	1
the	1
gunwale	1
again	1
and	1
rising	1
to	1
its	1
level	1
on	1
a	1
combing	1
wave	1
hurled	1
themselves	1
bodily	1
inboard	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
man	1
helplessly	1
dropping	1
astern	1
but	1
still	1
afloat	1
and	1
swimming	1
	1
almost	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
volition	1
of	1
ungraduated	1
instantaneous	1
swiftness	1
the	1
white	1
whale	1
darted	1
through	1
the	1
weltering	1
sea	1
but	1
when	1
ahab	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
steersman	1
to	1
take	1
new	1
turns	1
with	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
hold	1
it	1
so	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
crew	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
seats	1
and	1
tow	1
the	1
boat	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mark	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
treacherous	1
line	1
felt	1
that	1
double	1
strain	1
and	1
tug	1
it	1
snapped	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1

	1
what	1
breaks	1

of	1

the	1

wheeled	1
round	1
to	1

his	1
blank	1

at	1

in	1
that	1
evolution	1
catching	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

folded	1
